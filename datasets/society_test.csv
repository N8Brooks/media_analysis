4,"I will keep this short and sweet and exactly how I see it. I don't want my race or my culture to extinct. I am quite disgusted when I see black-white couples because it is simply a ""fuck you"" to their background. This is a rather fucked up thing and it isn't racist to be proud of your skin colour like it seems to be.",1
4,"People who are mixed race show more resistance to disease, are taller and for the most part are more attractive than others who are not racially mixed. Everyone is mixed to a certain degree, but the lack of genetic diversity leads to defective offspring. The only way to combat this is to mix, and give the child superior genetics so that they may survive and can evolve with the times.",-1
4,Race mixing destroys the diversity among human beings. It is part of the cultural marxist agenda which aims to destroy in particular the white european peoples so the marxists have no opposition and can install global communism. Race mixing is financed and led by jews who invented cultural marxism. End,1
4,"As a mixed race who is a black and white breed I disagree 100%. We shouldn't be forced to love someone just to keep a race pure. Mix racing is just a sign that two people from different races cared less about race and probably loved each other. But everyone has a perspective. If you prefer to stay pure even though pure people already have admixtures than do whatever makes you happy but don't disrespect others because they know Love has no colors. The mixed race is growing and no matter how you complain you will never stop it and they'll keep growing. Come on man, it isn't gonna kill you. At the end of the day the mixed race is human like everyone else. And it’s funny how people have a religion but forget that their religious book says to respect others for who they are. I don't care if it is white genocide or genocide for all. We will all still have culture and carry it with us in the future to.",-1
22,"That women is killing a baby that hasn't even done anything to her. She is doing wrong she should at least spar the child's life there are at least 1 child that's dying right now. And about 125,000 abortions happen per day. There are at least a few people that are regretting abortion.",1
22,Women have a moral right to decide what to do with their bodies the right to abortion is vital for gender equality the right to abortion is vital for individual women to achieve their full potential banning abortion puts women at risk by forcing them to use illegal abortionists the right to abortion should be part of a portfolio of pregnancy rights that enables women to make a truly free choice whether to end a pregnancy,-1
22,"The more abortion is understood, the more one realizes it is anti-human, anti-life, and anti-woman. The notion that we are in the business of ""changing hearts and minds"" has, regrettably, been reduced to cliche, but it is nevertheless true. Abortion is different from any other modern social issue debated today, and many people are suffering because of it. Prayerfully, and for the sake of women and their babies, let us go after those hearts and minds armed with knowledge and animated by compassion.",1
22,"It is a fetus. It has no consciousness or feeling at all. It isn't a child, or a baby. It is a fetus or an embryo or a zygote. A baby or child is something that is living and breathing and can survive on its own. If you kill the mother in the first or second trimester of her pregnancy, the fetus will not survive. It physically cannot survive because, technically, you can count it as a parasite. It feeds off the mother, using her food and water and air. It will not survive on its own. A person kills flies more developed than the fetus, and eats meat from animals more developed than this embryo. So, to be against abortion, you also can't eat meat or hit and kill flies that are biting you because it's alive. Abortion isn't murder.",-1
23,"Everyone who says that the police are racist need to check what is going on in the world. The only cases which you hear about are on the news with blacks. This is only because of this thing called STATISTICS. Now many will say that they arrest more blacks. Yes that is true. This is only true because those are the people they catch for doing these crimes. I'm not being racist, I am going off of statistics and I advise that you do that as well!",1
23,"Police do very much abuse their power, not all of them do though. But the ones that do, I think they need to be punished for it, the people they abuse their power on don't deserve that they should be able to trust the police and with police going around hurting people because they have power I think that is wrong.",-1
23,Most cops are good and they risk their lives to protect us. They deserve respect for their hard work not disrespectful people making their lives hell. Respecting our police officers would eliminate the need for the use of force. And it's ridiculous that people care more about criminals lives that police officers lives.,1
23,"Around 100 cops die every year, half of those are from car accidents some friendly fire and medical issues. I mention this because the main reason some people seem to blindly respect police is the false perception that they sacrifice their lives for the people. On top of a fairly safe job they average starting pay and benefits that exceed the average household income. Over 50% of violent crimes go unsolved while police focus on arresting drug users and confiscating property. If the police want respect they should change, the problem is they would rather have money and they take it through force. Every ticket issued is potential money for local businesses that is lost, Raises, bonuses, profits, and salaries are all lower thanks to cops wanting more for themselves.",-1
28,"It did me a lot of good growing up. When you're a kid and think you're a big shot, nothing brings you down to earth better than having to take all your clothes off and getting whipped naked with the belt. Knowing this was the punishment I'd get kept me out of a lot of trouble.",1
28,"Hitting your children can cause them to misbehave and eventually start hitting other kids, thinking it's okay. As a child i was hit for my misbehavior and it caused me to act out even more resulting in my mother abusing me. Hitting your children can very easily get carried away.",-1
28,"Sometimes kids don't understand any other language - and trust me as a parent it has been very difficult for me to deal with hitting my child (the emotional pain caused to me) whenever I have had to hit/spank my child. But sometimes he does things that are way beyond his reach and my patience - stealing money. Only done once but if it would not have been stopped in time it could have got out of hand. Repetitive hitting - NO, NO, but for grave offences, maybe, yes. I know who defines the grave offences - that is a judgement call each parent has to take, and be very honest with yourself. Are you doing it for the good of the child or just taking your frustration with life out on the poor soul who cannot respond back in an equal manner as yet.",1
28,"Hitting your spouse is domestic violence, Hitting a prisoner is assault, And so is hitting a stranger. They are all human, And so are children. I can understand a light tap on the hand, But spanking kids is unacceptable. It’s been shown to lead to a heightened risk of mental illness and makes your child feel unloved. In a survey, It was found that children who were subjected to corporal punishment as they grew up were more likely to exhibit antisocial, And even egocentric behaviour in their adulthood. There are so many reasons to not hit a child. Abuse is abuse, No matter how old the victim is.",-1
29,"A teenager's right to privacy is not more important than a parent's need to know, because parents are still responsible for their children. With parents responsible for what their children do, the parents need to be able to monitor their children. Society cannot complain that parents do not help their children enough while simultaneously complaining that they are too intrusive in their children's lives.",1
29,Don't call a child a minor. Haven't you heard of maturity? Well it's not mature to call a child a minor. Now unless you have facts to prove that statement then you have no right to call a child that. Children and teens need their own SPACE! We all have our own buble and so do they. Don't be selfish and let that child be! If there was something wrong with the child you could tell. So there's no need for being a snoop.,-1
29,"My child lives in my house, she does not have a job or money, she is under 18. I WILL read her texts until she is on her own. Period. Again, there is no 'allowed' about it. It is plain and simply something that WILL happen. Until she is old enough to support herself, provide for herself and or any mistakes she might make, I will be aware of what going on in her life. She can have complete freedom from these things when she can provide it for herself.",1
29,"Teens need privacy. I was caught by the law, me and my boyfriend were having sex in his car in the park parking lot a couple blocks away from my high school. A cop pulled up and caught us, he had us call our parents, that was the last time i got to see my prince. This isn't the first time I've been in trouble with my parents. Even if i do a minor thing like swear they check my phone. My dad called me a whore, but eventually and thanks to my mom they put me on birth control and accepted i like sex, yet they still want to check my phone, This makes me not trust them, I'm getting a job soon so i can pay for my own phone bill and therefore they won't have a right to look at my phone. I am starting to hate my parents and pray for my dad to get in a car crash and die to be completely honest. He use to be physically abusive, but now he's emotionally abusive. Let your child have privacy on their phone, unless you want them to hate you and wish for you to die.",-1
30,"Weed is rapidly decreasing the IQ of our youth. We as the human race are supposed to keep improving, keep growing, and moving in the right direction. Not only does weed drop the motivation of people, but it just simply makes us morons. Why we are even having a debate on why it's illegal is nonsense. All of my friends have changed because of it, everyone is self absorbed and just stupid now. It decreases your social abilities and makes people very hard to talk to. Now, I do believe it should be for medical purposes and decriminalized, but in no way become legal for recreational purposes. We already have alcohol and tobacco products to keep people occupied, why legalize another substance? If you wanna smoke pot, go ahead. But we do not need it being legal in our country. People are focusing more on legalizing weed, the real world problems. It needs to stop.",1
30,"Marijuana is not a gateway drug. That is one of the only arguments that prohibitionists use. The majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, ""harder"" substances. Marijuana decreases eh dopamine levels in the brain. If smoked at a realistic age, then smoking marijuana should have a steady effect on a person. Therefore not leading them to stronger, more dangerous drugs.",-1
30,Once marijuana is legalize people would abuse the fact that it is legal to have marijuana. People will buy a lot of marijuana. It would affect society.It also will cause pollution. Many people will start doing the drug and get addicted. Furthermore marijuana can cause someone to be mentally ill and can kill you onced abuses.,1
30,"There is no chance to overdose on marijuana, very tiny chance to be addicted and is certainly a less likely to get you addicted than other prescription drugs. And if that wasn't enough, there are 6 deaths a day from alcohol poisoning in the US and 0 deaths of all time for marijuana overdose.",-1
35,Welfare is just a waste of taxpayers money. Most of the people on welfare abuse it. All they do is sit around and do nothing all day and think of other ways to get away without doing anything in life. All they do is sell food stamps to buy drugs and what not and most of welfare people don't use welfare for necessities. Most of them have phones and computers and everything. And what they cant buy they steal. Welfare is just a bad idea and needs to stop!,1
35,"I think the government should help the working poor not the lazy poor. The government could give the working poor a monthly check or money order worth say 700 dollars a month. The government could buy and or build apartment complexes and let poor people live their for free for say 6 months after that just charge them 20% of their monthly income. Poor people need a fulltime job and a place to live. Paycheck stubs are a way the working poor could prove to the government that they are working then the government could give them extra money on a weekly basis. Working poor people earn on average 250 dollars a week. So the government could give them a check or money order worth 250 dollars also. So that given poor person would have 500 dollars a week but only if he or she keeps working any legal job. Illegal drug dealing, prostitution, violence are not jobs. I am all for helping poor people just the working poor. Anyone making less than 500 a week is income poor in my opinion. The government could give them gift cards so they can buy. By the way taxpayers do not keep the government open. The government keeps the taxpayers open. The government prints the paper money supply that all Americans use. Money is a government program anyway. Plus the contract laws and regulations, the government's legal authority plays a big role in keeping both the private and public sector jobs. Businesses and corporations depend on police and military to protect their property. Public school teachers are paid by the government they teach students the math and English skills that business word depends on. Banks need workers that can read and do math. All contracts in America are written in English. The courts uphold what in theses contact documents to help workers and customers buy, sell and trade in a smoother more safer manner. If you buy a car you get paperwork stating that you own the vehicles this proves your the owner. Mailing addresses also play a big role. Every business and job place needs a legal address how could transport mail shipments tools if the government didn't assign buildings with a proper street address. So in order for capitalism to even work some government socialism is needed to set some fair rules for people to live and work buy. Little children should not be working or sold into slavery they should be in school.",-1
35,The country has too much debt to continue this road. I feel poor should be helped in communities they live and community could control who needs help. There could be a food bank set up for help. I think it so unfair for taxpayers to pick up tab for the fraud and abuse of something suppose to help. The government cannot run anything and unfortunately there are people who are never going to contribute to society.,1
35,"Jobless people deserve welfare. If they do not have a steady source of employment at the moment, the government should look out for them and give them some money to tide them over until they have another job. The government's job is to make sure that all its citizens are okay.",-1
43,"First, we need a death penalty because we would have fewer criminals and no one would miss them because they are criminals and we would have few crimes such as school shootings, Bank robbing, Shoplifting, And many more crimes we would have more money so thing like schools could afford more field trips and pay government officials more. SO LET GOD SORT THEM OUT. It's obvious they are not going to heaven.",1
43,"It's not fair. The majority of the people who have been killed on the death penalty or been on it have been innocent! Imagine killing an innocent person for committing a crime he did not do. Also, criminals would prefer to die than to spend their whole life in a cell, I know I would. It's simply not fair and think about it, the people that kill the criminals on death row, shouldn't they be killed too? I mean, they are committing a murder. Think about it.",-1
43,"Moral justification of the death penalty can be justified by one simple principle: punishment should be roughly apportioned in severity to the nature of the crime. The criminal justice system throughout the world is grounded on this basic concept. While there are understandable variations from society to society on the specifics of punishments, the principle remains universal. If a society chooses through established and legitimate means to impose the death penalty for an identifiable set of particularly heinous criminal behaviors, there is no principled basis on which to object other than the speciality of the punishment due to its finality insofar as the ending of a human life is concerned. Certainly ending the life of a person who has committed what society has determined to be as a specially horrible offense does not lower society to the level of a murderer for one obvious reason: society, not the individual, has the ultimate legitimate power to determine what behaviors are unacceptable and what punishments may flow from violations thereof. Individuals have no legitimate power to determine what is criminal or to impose punishments. Therefore, in no principled way may the taking of a life by an individual be equated with capital punishment, nor can capital punishment be equated with murder. To conclude otherwise would require equating arrest with kidnapping and taxation with theft. The State, when acting lawfully, may use force legitimacy where individuals may not.",1
43,Killing a person to show that killing another person is wrong does not even make sense? It is really hypocritical. The death penalty financial cost is also very high we pay more to kill a person than to keep them in jail. Who knew death was more expensive than life?,-1
45,"Though the flexibility of art may define as art in one way or another it is undeniable that Abstract is an excuse to pass off bad art as good. The lack of form and general structure is a major factor why this is, If you are unable to glance at a picture and at least have a clue what it may be depicting than chances are you have failed to produce a proper piece of art. Though some abstract may yes look good they mostly look good to those who do not possess an artistic mind. So in conclusion, No, It isn't good art. It's lack of structure, Theory, Representation and general skill is both lacking and missing, And should not be considered a proper art form both in general and when being compared to someone with actual skill like Thomas Kinkade or Gustave Courbet.",1
45,"Everything is art, Whether you like it or not. Everything done with intention is art, As described in one of the posts, But I disagree that splatter paint is without intention. Did the pain decide to splatter on its own will? Obviously a human intended to splatter it, Therefore it's art. All photography is art, Regardless of how low quality or abstract it may be. Someone's intention, A press of a button is required to photograph, Therefore it's art. Sex is art because someone is choosing to do it aka doing it with intention. It doesn't happen spontaneously. The universe doesn't just decide to throw two people together and make them have sex. Therefore, It is art. It does not matter if you think some piece of art is beautiful, Attractive, Skilful, Of good quality, Or pleasant to look at. Art is not there to please. “Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable. ” - Banksy. Although even if it doesn't do any of that, It's still art.",-1
45,Abstract art is wacky. I personally can find no redeeming quality in any abstract art that I have seen. It all appears to be the work of someone who cannot produce good art. Abstract art is a cop out for an artist being bad or lazy. It has no place in this world.,1
45,Art is art. Of course it would have helped to have defined art in this instance as visual art. Someone might be amazing at music but terrible at drawing. Are they a bad artist.?? Is all abstract art the same? Are not some abstract art pieces more visually pleasing or containing more meaning than others? I'd answer yes to both,-1
49,"Mothers should stay home and raise their own children. Mothers who place their babies, especially newborn babies, in day care, and leave them there 40-50 hours per week are causing irreparable damage to the development of the baby; he or she will grow up with some sort of attachment disorder. Most children are left in daycare these days, and that is one reason why the crime rate is so high, why prisons are overcrowded, why bullying is rampant in schools, why school violence is prevalent. We are raising unattached, conscienceless children because we are leaving them at five to six weeks old in the care of inadequate, poorly staffed day care centers, and our babies are growing up without the capacity to love, feel empathy and compassion, and to have healthy relationships with people. It should be a law for someone--whether it's the mother or father--to stay at home and care for the baby until the child reaches the age to attend preschool.",1
49,Because women have a right to do whatever they want and are not slaves. What is the difference between males and females? Why is it always women? Why can't men stay home? Women are just as important as men are. I think i said exactly what was on my mind about women portrayal.,-1
49,"Women are supposed to stay at home because they are the ones who gave birth to their children and they are the ones who are to nurture tem. The middle east way of life is that women should not go to work, They should stay at home and scrub the floor.",1
49,"Women are equal to men, if anything women should be superior as there are more females than males. Stating that a woman's place is at home is disregarding everything that women have done for the benefit of the world, imagine if people like Mother Teresa had stayed at home and became a housewife?",-1
50,"The economic development of developing countries should take priority over the environment in said countries. The economy can be supported by this resource extraction. Many will argue imperialist cases, but the reality is that if the country obtains the resources, it can use them or sell them, both boosting the economy. Imperialism is not involved in any way, and corporations can only mine these resources if allowed by the government of the developing country.",1
50,"This environment existed far before humans came and decided that they should destroy everything. We should not destroy more nature than we already have to get more resources that we could find alternatives to. We can replace resources, not the environment after we have destroyed it. In the long run, preserving our environment will prove to be a valuable resource for our survival.",-1
50,"Deforestation is necessary for the development of a country. It enhances the income, infrastructure and especially the economic activities of a country. It brings profit to a country. We can make use of trees in many ways. We need wood to make furniture, wood as a fuel etc. This is actually my opinion as i have a debate in my class and i support for deforestation",1
50,"Yes, we must absolutely end the bad practice of deforestation, but not for the reasons normally stated. The true reason that we must end deforestation is because the trees are part of a delicate system which intakes carbon dioxide and produces oxygen. By cutting down too many trees, this environmental process is interrupted and it damages our ozone layer.",-1
53,"When God created the universe, he gave man guidelines, which are the Ten Commandments (Exodus). The first four relate to our relationship with God, and the rest our relationships with each other. In these, are the moral laws: thou shalt not steal, commit adultery, bear false witness, or covet thy neighbor's wife. Men have been keeping most of these laws, whether intentionally or habitually, throughout the ages, and our civil laws are based on these moral laws. Therefore, it is impossible for man to live morally or ethically without the guidance of religion.",1
53,Religion is not necessary to be moral since being moral simply just means to be ethical and respect peers around you in your environment; it is built within us in our human nature to be kind to others. It is fundamental that we respect every body's views although maybe not agreeing with them and being kind to all to create a world of peace and harmony.,-1
53,"Man was created by God and for His glory. Since man did not create himself, he is incapable of governing himself. God gave the Ten Commandments and the Scriptures to man to live by and Jesus as man's personal Savior. Until man accepts God as his Creator, the Ten Commandments and the Scriptures as his guide in life, and Jesus Christ as his personal Savior, he will continue to live a life without happiness and fulfillment.

53,"Most evil in the world is committed in the name if religion, the world would be far better place for everyone if there was no religion for people to use to justify murder, genocide, putting themself above other people, saying people who love each other cant get married, etc, etc.",-1
56,"I personally believe telling/teaching children about atheism should be considered child abuse. Besides, teaching religion to children is not child abuse nor indoctrination, it is educating a young soul on his origins and of our Lord, God Almighty. Children must learn of faith, or our entire civilization will face collapse and the wrath of God. If these children learn atheism instead of faith, they will burn in Hell, and no one wants that. The teaching of religion to children must be supported and expanded upon, for the sake of the world",1
56,"People seem to only consider physical abuse as abuse when emotional abuse counts just as bad, if not worse. Christian Religion can scare the crap out of a kid, I mean you're telling them that if they end up in hell, they'll burn for all eternity and that they'll deserve it because some imaginary God said so. As I was growing up, more than 1 person, including my cousins told me I was going to hell because I had issues following rules and had too much of imagination (got me into a lot of trouble). Not all religion is damaging, like the Jews are doing pretty well; they don't teach hate and scare people with hell fire. Buddhists teach people to mind their own business and don't seem to push their sh*t onto people so.. I'm saying only certain religion damages kids.",-1
56,This provide pupils with space for reflection. We shouldn't stop practicing Christianity in schools in a Christian country. When people go abroad they want to embrace the culture. So if they went to England they would expect there to be Religious practices in school. Just because there are more immigrants in the country doesn't mean we should stop practicing our religion to fit with there beliefs.,1
56,"So why on earth should religion be taught in school. It is nothing more than a discriminating factor that leads to bullying, and inequality among student especially in larger school settings. In my opinion any and all religious views should not be taught or brought up in any public setting other than designated places of worship.",-1
57,"You get pregnant and he leaves you? What if he just wants you for sex? In my opinion, it's not worth the risk. Real love waits and if he can't wait, you should probably just consider a way out. He should be able to respect your decision of waiting till you're ready to do it. Not just rush and pressure you into doing it and threatening to leave you if you won't do it with him.",1
57,"This day in age, premarital sex is totally acceptable. Now that being said I'm not advocating going out and sleeping with as many people as possible, but it is absolutely ok to have sex with a person that you care about or are in a committed relationship with. Sex isn't just for reproduction, it can be a totally amazing and satisfying experience under the right circumstances. Human sexuality is big part of relationships and if you don't experience it how will you ever find what you like? What if you end up marrying a person you are totally not sexually compatible with? DIVORCE CITY.",-1
57,Because kids these days kids are having sex at young age and they should waite because teengers are getting pregnant at young like 13-18 years old an the don't won't kids at a young age an the baby dads leave them and don't take care of their kid and it's sad but some do stay and take care of them but i think it's best to wait in till your married because you half to get prego at a young age,1
57,"For the non-religious such as myself, marriage is mostly a string of legal benefits. As long as you trust the person you're with, use protection, and are comfortable, you can have sex at any stage of a relationship that you choose. Likewise, you can also have a loving and committed relationship outside of the context of marriage.",-1
58,"A child needs both Mom and Dad. Not two Moms, and not two Dads. A father can never make up for the place of a mother. This subjects is usually about the couple, but we need to stop and remember the child. The child needs both parents to have a healthy house. Being raised by two dads or two moms is no different than living in a divorced house. You have plenty of one parent, but none of the other.",1
58,"The idea that two gay people are incapable or at least less capable at raising a child then the rampantly corrupt system of foster care is ridiculous. If two people are ready, willing, and able to raise a child, then why deny them? If one person claims to have this ability and happens to be gay, why would we deny them? If society is truly worried about the child growing up with same sexual ideas as the gay couple, put females with only gay guys and males with only gay women. Problem solved.",-1
58,"As you all know, gay marriage is not a thing we should accept in our world and you ca read more here Children who are adopted by gay couples will and most possible follow in their footsteps and the result? MORE GAY PEOPLE. Homosexuality is against nature. By letting gay couples adopt children, the children will have a very confusing life.",1
58,"When people say it's unnatural for a man and man or a woman and a woman to raise children, as they cannot conceive them themselves, it is like saying one shouldn't be able to make use of modern medicine as it is unnatural. It is not fair for a person to be denied this right simply because of antiquated religious reasoning.",-1
60,"If it's a matter of morals, prostitution is definitely wrong. We shouldn't be teaching others that it is an acceptable way of life. Selling your body for material gain is unacceptable. It spreads diseases and completely demolishes the ideas of companionship and love. Sex should be between two people that know each other, and have feelings for each other. NOT between two strangers.",1

60,"There have been too many cases in America where people have been polygamists, and have caused great harm to the women to whom they were married. I think polygamy is terrible, because it often views women as something that exists merely for a man's pleasure. Marriage is meant to be beautiful and equal. It is never meant to demean one gender for the lusts of another.",1
60,"I'm a shy person who loves her husband but would not mind sharing him with a woman-also a friend as long as we are all contributing. It would be nice to have a confidante and friend all the time. I find it more ""normal"" then homosexuality or bi or polyandry.",-1
61,"I do not believe that homosexuality is a natural state whatsoever. I firmly believe that homosexuality is a choice, made consciously or subconsciously by the lifestyle in which a person was brought up in and around. For homosexuality to be a natural state it would somehow have to have an impact on the reproduction of that species. This obviously is not the case as reproduction cannot be obtained by homosexuality, be it male or female.",1
61,"Homosexuality is normal and natural to hundreds of other animal species... why would it not be natural for humans to be homosexual? Bringing up points like 'religion A says it's bad', or stating that it is nature's response to overpopulation is just conjecture with no current means of proving either way. Humans are animals. Other animals exhibit homosexual behavior naturally. Therefore human homosexual activity is normal and natural.",-1
61,"People are not born gay. It's just another excuse for people to do that BS. These people are confused. I think it's some kind of mental illness or some way of controlling the population by promoting this crap. It's not right, why would I get a man that acts and dresses like a woman when I could just get a woman? People are seriously defending and supporting this stuff as if it is right. It's just a stage in life that you need to get over. If you can't get over it, guys, try some sex with an vagina. If you don't like it, try it again.Lol!

As someone said in a previous answer, you don't wake up one day and think ""oh you know what I think I'm gay, bi, or anything along those lines"" that's not how it works! It's something you discover about yourself not chose to be. Like in my case, I knew I was bi since I learned what it meant. Did I chose to be it? No, not at all. That's how I was born! I was born being attracted to both genders and I'm proud of that. Also as some other people mentioned, it was scientifically proven to be born gay. I don't know the full details on that though so I can't really say anything more about it. I just wish that people could understand this and not blow it out of proportion.",-1

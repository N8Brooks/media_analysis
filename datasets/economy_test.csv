9,"With Communism, you can get what you need, no more, no less, and for all free. This will topple the barrier of poverty and wealth, creating a nirvana of balance in the world. If a man is hungry, why give everyone bread, for a cost, then everyone gets to poor, and goes hungry. Capitalism if a man is hungry, give that man bread, for no price, so he need not extra bread in the future, and everyone is the greatest they can be. Communism",-1
9,"I work and I earn my money. The government has no right to take it to spend on lazy welfare cheats. Get a job! I didn't have children because I was a responsible person. I didn't want to raise children and I don't want to raise yours. I work for what I have. I shouldn't have to work to support you, your children or anyone else's children. If others want to then let them pay the welfare tab. Then we will see how quickly attitudes change.",1
9,"But, I think a more aggressive monetary policy is justified as inflation is low and unemployment is high. Although, a predictable, rules based policy is extremely important.",-1
9,"Working at a Medicaid clinic allowed me to see families with five kids refusing to work. Promoting abuse of free healthcare and food benefits without proper government oversight is disastrous. Create government commissaries that only sell (or ship) nutritious, economical food. Pay for childcare and education, not waste and abuse.",1
9,"Communism does work and who says it doesn't thinks of money. By example: the ussr wasn't rich in 1917 (only farms) and it wouldn't become rich still they became an very industrialized country. For a state that does not work had they in my opinion won the space race; USSR: first satellite first man in space first women in space first dog in space first man to go around the world USA: first man on the moon and yes in the soviet union died people of hunger but probably not more than their die in america from bad healthcare if you can't pay it. On decrease of liberty, indeed you may not say what you want but in many capitalist african countries you can get arrested for talking against your government's policies. At last you will probably say that capitalist countries are richer and have a better quality of live. If you only look to the west but on global level you see that the west is rich by exploitation: if you go to the supermarkt and you buy shoes then they are made by indian child labour. If you buy exotic fruit then is made by farmers earning one euro a day unless you buy fairtrade but if you know the west is capitalistic you also know that 5 euro bananas doesn't sale very good. And know I mentioned the democratic India did you know India has 90 billionaires but still lives 50% of indians under the poverty line don't tell me that the majority in india loves capitalism and hates communism.",-1
9,"Welfare is an abomination of everything this country stands for. In the land of the free, we are bred to be competitive; it's kill or be killed. In essence we have the potential to succeed at whatever our hearts desire. Obviously underprivileged demographics are at a disadvantage, so brings forth the fact that we should focus on the infrastructure their schools and public services. According to our creation law natural selection, the fit will survive. Welfare has created a virus, a specimen of human with no strive for achievement; but that goes without saying.",1
9,"Communism can allow all people to get what they need, and to get a fair wage in comparison with everyone else. Communism can make it so people are not defined by what you do, or how much you make, but rather to be looked at as a person. People are not always, drones, or merely mindless consumers.",-1
9,Tired of paying for other people to be lazy. I work for the cable company and spend most of my day in government housing. I have to go and wake them up at noon and go into their filthy houses. Being poor is one thing but cleaning products are cheap. They receive our tax money and have no job yet they have 300 dollar a month cable bills. I work hard and the government takes money from my family and gives it to lazy people who chose not to work.,1
9,"In America, the masses have been told that Communism is an evil from of government where your belongings are taken from you, an evil dictator rules, and they and determines who lives and dies. However, who are the people who control most of American politics? The rich and powerful, with all their money, which in America means influence. They are afraid of what they would lose in a Communist society, and what everyone else would gain. People in Capitalist countries argue that Communism takes motivation away from people, but motivation is only needed in a country where most of the population is self-centered. In Communism, the population is taught as they are raised that everyone is equal, and how to share and do things that benefit everyone. This provides the drive to do things like develop technology and work. As for the one-party system so many people fear, it is actually beneficial. The population all have been raised on the ideal that community comes first, and so that helps to prevent corruption in the government. This system also allows things to get don't better and faster, because there is no petty squabble over what the individual wants. Overall, the richest people in Capitalist countries have brainwashed their citizens into believing they would lose much to Communism, when actually they would gain a lot. The economy would thrive because the population believes in the common good over individual ambitions and greed, and the government would function faster and better then in a Capitalist country. Don't fall for the lies of the wealthiest individuals, or look at the false attempts at Communism like the USSR or North Korea. Do your homework and you will discover how beneficial Communism really is.",-1
9,"The design of the welfare system was meant to assist those of need; however, because of the rise of taxes, debt, and expectancy, from most who get welfare, to be supported forever there has been a negative impact on both society and welfare recipients. Not only does every penny that the government takes, for welfare, go to those who actually need it but unfortunately it also goes to those who like to abuse the welfare system as well. At least put some limitations on how long people should be allowed to receive it. Like 3 years max and not given again to the same person because if there is a limitation of time on help don't you think people would start to look for a job because they know for a fact that they can't just live off the government and not only that but people will not be able to blame it on.it's like giving them a fish or teaching them how to fish what is better for them.",1
18,"Demand creates jobs. Currently in our society, the wealthy are making historically high profits. If they have so much money, and they are the ones creating jobs, then, by default, shouldn't we also have record high job creation? Tax the rich more, lots more, OR increase the minimum wage to keep up with the ever increasing cost of living.",-1
18,"Just because someone is able to go ahead and be successful in the world, does not mean that they should be taxed because of it. A tax should be applied to all people, not just one class of people. It takes years to make a lot of money in the world. Being successful or knowing the ins and outs of a business, economic, or political world is not something to be punished be a tax. It is almost like saying, ""Congratulations on your new earned money, now remember that favor I asked of you twenty years ago?"" or ""Remember that bet that you lost?"" It just isn't civil.",1
18,"The rich should pay more taxes. The rich have municipal bond interest, annuities, tax free foundations, wages that are exempt from social security taxes. Of course their rates should be higher. AND, our government continues to bail-out the super-rich, subsidize other rich individuals through their corporations, and fund the military/industrial complex through endless foreign wars.",-1
18,The simplistic argument is that you shouldn't have to be penalized for success. I believe in flat rate taxation with no deductions or loopholes for anyone. You shouldn't be forced to pay for other person's goods. And you should have a power of choice which taxation takes away from you.,1
18,"Only one percent of the U.S is in the upper class. The upper class is the top layer of society in the United States, consisting of those with great wealth and power and may also be referred as the rich.They are 100x more wealthy than the average American, compared to where twenty percent of people polled last month said they sometimes didn't have enough money to put food on the table. The wealthy should have enough money to take care of the poor, and a way that can be don't is if they are taxed.The poor should not pay more taxes then the rich, because the poor don't have enough money to maintain the engines of capitalism, so the poor need help from the wealthy to support that.. The rich, being the wealthy have majority of the money in the United States. They must be charged with higher taxes to not only be fair but to help close the wealth gap. The wealthy upper class have well enough money to support the poor. their may be a small amount of billionaires in the world but they make up a lot of the money in the world, they have a lot of extra money that can be put to a good cause and help the poor with wealth problems. their is a very big difference between the wealthy and the poor, the wealth can support their self and others like the poor, were as the poor can barely support their self, the poor need lots of help from the wealth to get back on their feet, and a way that can be don't is if the rich have higher taxes. The rich will still have plenty of money after higher taxes. Sixty eight percent of millionaires say they support the tax increase for those earning $1 million or more, according to a survey by The spectrum group. The poor have been trying to support the engines of capitalism, but are just getting buried in more taxes, the only way out of their wealth gap is a little help from the wealthy, the wealthy have been able to support their businesses, themselves and still have extra money to spend on whatever they like. One of the best things their extra money could go to is the poor, that will not only help close the wealth gap but help Americans live an equal life to others.",-1
18,"I am by no means a wealthy person but I still believe in treating people fairly. The wealthy should not be punished for being successful. Everyone talks of the tax breaks for the rich but they already pay a disproportionate amount of taxes. Do a little research and see. IRS figures show the top 1 percent of earners take home 16.9 percent of the nation's total income, but pay 36.7 percent of the nation's income taxes. The top 5 percent take home a little more than 31 percent of total income but pay almost 59 percent of all income taxes. And the top 10 percent earn just over 43 percent of the total income but pay more than 70 percent of all income taxes. The other 90% of us only pay 30% of income taxes. It seems that the majority of the people for more taxes on the wealthy pay no taxes at all in fact 47% of Americans paid no income taxes at all in 2011. Just like in most other situations in our country it is easier to point the finger at someone else then to hold ourselves accountable.",1
18,It will lessen the wealth gap in America and put more of a regulation on how much a person can make in a sense that we don't want them to have the chance to make a monopoly. Take Disney for example. They pretty much own everything and is worth millions then they should be taxed more then the independent businesses that don't have millions in net worth.,-1
18,"All that is really gained by having corporations pay a higher level of taxation is that the cost will be passed on to the consumer, or the company will simply move their headquarters to another country. Better to have them pay a lower rate then to pay none at all.",1
18,"The middle class work just as hard if not harder for their paycheck. So, why should they suffer to pay more taxes? It doesn't make sense as to why the rich shouldn't have to pay more since they're not hurting for money. The middle class can barely make it as it is.",-1
18,I came from nothing and worked my way to the top 2%. Now I should be penalized for my hard work with more taxes then the middle class? America is the land of opportunity. If you want to get out of the lower/middle class then do something about it. Quit asking the 2% to pay more. How about you work more. When you raise taxes on people who own the companies that employ middle and low class Americans it leaves them with no choice but to let people go. it's not logical to tax the people creating jobs more. All that will do is lead to less jobs. Then you will complain about not having a job.,1
11,"Pure communism, not like the ones in North Korea or in USSR is the best way to make society a better place. Everyone would be the same and no one would be excluded. In that case robbers, hobos, the poor wouldn't exist. Many of wars around the globe would end, and many lives would be spared",-1
11,"It isn't fair. If i work my butt off in school, why should i be paid the same as a janitor? It would be good for lazy people with no ambition, but it's not fair for all the people with goals. I am very against the stupidity of the theory of communism",1
11,"Capitalism kills and communism heals. Cliff, For your essay you could say that communism allows people to live without the fear of wondering where their next meal will come from. Also, You could play so much Minecraft if you lived in a communist society and if Hitler was your mom.",-1
11,All communism does is ruin the country. there is nothing good about communism although it promises good things to the people in reality it puts a dictator at the head of the government and peasants are everybody else. During the cold war people under the iron curtain and in the USSR we're starving and had no rights. Every countries except the ones who have just recently accepted communism has failed and has been demolished this is why communism is bad and terrible thing.,1
11,"Communism supports equality and fairness. Also, If the whole world were communist I bet you there would be no wars. If the whole world were capitalist, there would be a lot of wars just like what history has shown. Do I also have to mention that Lenin is more of a hero then any capitalist?",-1
11,"The problem is, that the communist governments never actually accomplished the equal distribution method. However, the leaders of that particular country have a lot more money then the people. Also, the equal range is the range which puts people into poverty. The government itself runs practically everything, which makes them have a lot more power over people.",1
11,"We see that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer but no one pays heed to these warnings. We see facts like the richest 1% own the same as everyone else. Gentlemen, the era of political and religious revolutions has, however, come to an end. People realise that the egoist life-consciousness and it's forms of existence, the Church and State, will disappear of their own accord, but not before the egoist life, working for one’s private account, the traffic in humans disappear. As long as this practical egoism has not disappeared talking to man about philosophy, freedom, reason and love will be fruitless. The mass of men will not believe that human life and life in general is love, truth and freedom.",-1
11,"Just as capitalism and socialism, communism fails to take into account for human greed, error, and aspirations towards something greater. Humans have a natural instinct to benefit themselves and their cronies, so it only follows that they should do whatever they need to maintain what they have and eventually gain more. The problem with capitalism is that this inevitably leaves the majority of the population in relative poverty as compared to the wealthy elite. In socialism and communism, the problem is in implementation. To create economic parity(as individuals are generally to give what they have, especially to a government) authorities must take what they need by force. Socialism is far more moderate in practice then communism, and it only follows that it should be a more convenient and appealing choice then the latter. To be sure, communism in theory is on par with capitalism and socialism. However, just like them, the principles are only applicable in a utopian society. Aside from that, communism on a moderate level will almost certainly take in elements from the other two systems muddying what it truly is and producing something that although more realistic, is not true communism. So I believe that in covering some basics of the socioeconomic theory, we must take a look as to its application in the real world and the results. Firstly, communism most often has taken root in the face of a crumbling capitalist society which has failed it's own goal of profits. The ensuing communist coup (in fashion of most revolutions but perhaps to an even greater extent) must fight, and even slaughter to maintain its newfound power. As history teaches us, this usually takes the form of a totalitarian state (USSR). Of course Western propaganda has given a somewhat muddied view of most communist states, what cannot be disregarded is the many inhumane, perhaps even genocidal, actions that both communist china and the soviet union committed in order to revolutionize under communist principles. It cannot be argued that these were not successful, as they clearly were, and it should also be noted that capitalist policies in the long-term produced somewhat similar results on the working class if given similar conditions. Regardless, communism proved cruel, and in the face of other systems, ineffective in producing goods needed to improve the lives of its adherents or competing on a great scale given the anti-consumerist policies.",1
11,"It can work if people weren't going to act selfishly. Of course you could say well I don't want to earn the same wage as a janitor if I am a doctor but that would be demeaning for the janitor because I need him. I need someone who is experienced and adequate with repairs, chemicals, machinery of that category and so on just like how if he gets harmed significantly he needs me to be able to fix him. We need each other no matter what so why am I supposed to make more than you? Simply because I do something different that is also needed? That's asinine. People need each other. If people sat down and went according to the needs of others as well as themselves we would not have a problem with communism. Take out karl marx execution ok? Take out the destroying those who are against and don't believe. Subsume them. Take their words and desires and see if it works for the benefit of all as well as the country as a whole. Everyone has a two story house with wifi, cable, nice refrigerator and good land. Farmers have the same thing but they also have a farm, engineers have the same thing. Everyone lives a significantly good way of life and can do even better as long as the people as a whole work hard enough for it and of course the political leader(s) orchestrate a valuable and trustworthy economical and political partnership with promising or neighboring countries. This will allow communism to spread positively and many will be able to enjoy the lifestyle and it will destroy selfishness and capitalism with an iron fist.",-1
11,"The main idea is quite sweet, everyone loves each other and it is a fairy land filled with equal opportunity for all. In theory this sounds good, but it is really a Trojan horse of evil. My mother, grandmother, and grandfather spent their entire lives in Soviet Georgia, now Georgia. They were brainwashed to believe they were living in paradise, but once the Soviets let Georgia go, they experienced capitalism and they never turned back. My mother cried when she saw what the rest of the world was like. The oppression and torment resulting in communist rule have never healed. They saw the opportunity in capitalism and had achieved success in America. My mother is now happily living without the thought of having radical ""Equal"" ideologies stuffed down her throat. If you think communism works, read a history book and I hope you realize how toxic Communism is.",1
25,"If state colleges were free, it's reasonable to assume every aimless teenager would attend, whether he actually wanted to learn anything or not. Colleges already offer huge grants, making college very affordable to students who have shown strong academic ability and the focus to use what they are taught. Also, loans are readily available to make college possible for students who need them. Loans encourage students to understand that college is not a chance to party in togas without your parents grounding you, it's an investment in your future. We need more students to take their college education seriously, not more students who want to party and don't feel like getting a job.",1
25,College should be free I think any and all education should be free. It is not right to have people pay for something that everyone should be able to have at their disposal. The way things are set up now make it so only the rich can get an education.,-1
25,"Museums, zoos, and science centers should not be funded by taxpayers' money because every citizen does not use these facilities. Taxpayers' money should go for things that we all benefit from, like fixing roads and bridges and making it safe to drive in the cities where we live. But if I don't ever go to the zoo, why should I have to pay for the zoo? I shouldn't have to pay for recreational facilities unless I choose to go their and then I can pay admission to get in.",1
25,"Zoos, museums, and science centers offer cultural and educational opportunities to all taxpayers. Not all taxpayers wish to take advantage of these opportunities, but that does not mean that they could not. I believe that the future depends on our children growing up to be educated and well-rounded. If we don't have access to these kinds of facilities--or access is so expensive only the wealthy can visit them--then we are hurting ourselves in the long run.",-1
25,"The arts are loosing public interest. Even if they are not, Why waste the money? The government has plenty other important stuff to fund on, And the arts is not one of them. The 'arts', As they say, Is more like trash. Well, I personally think trash is better indeed.",1
25,"Art is a cultural necessity, something I feel like this country is greatly lacking. Culture is extremely important, it's how one expresses themselves, and art is a large part of culture. Since it's such an important part of any country, the government should be responsible for funding it. Art as it is is severely underfunded in most places and over time it could be very detrimental. If art was included in our annual budget then it could get the kind of help it desperately needs.",-1
25,"No matter how amazing free college sounds, somebody has to pay for it. Sure, the first place we would turn would be the state, but where does the state get that money? You. Me. Every taxpayer this side of the Canadian border. ""Free"" college cannot exist. Sure, the student might not be paying while they're in school, but later on, the money will be taken from them. Okay, sure you can pay for college later, but how does this help people who choose to not go to college, or can't go? It doesn't. By making college ""free,"" the government would effectively be forcing people to pay for another's schooling.",1
25,I think education should be free because people around the world are poor and cannot afford education therefore they cannot go to college and they can't get an education and then if people don't have an education then they won't get jobs and then they won't be able to pay off their houses and they won't be able to pay the state either or debts,-1
25,"Spending taxes on art is seen as unnecessary. This is because art is just for specific groups, upper or middle classes, not for all citizens. In fact, people in poverty can not afford time to appreciate paintings and pictures. However, these people also have to pay taxes. In this respect, if governmental budget is invested in the sector, all the public can not benefit from this. Thus, I believe that the money should be spent on more valuable fields such as public health and poverty problems so that everyone can equally take advantages from government funding.",1
25,"Art does many things! And if you get frustrated or upset or not feeling well and you keep thinking about negative stuff, well art is right for you people! Draw, color, painting and being creative. Students who receive arts education can have more stronger social skills, improved motivation to learn and more esteem for themselves and their peers. Arts education helps to create a positive school environment in which learning and human development.",-1
39,"Many government have ""bailed out"" (given money to) failing companies such as General Motors but where is is going? Certainly not to the employees but rather pay rises and bonuses to leading members of the company. Despite billions of dollars of aid to companies employees were still let go and companies moved overseas (asia) or ""closed"" and the money invested by the government disappeared.",1
39,"I feel like we need to bail out banks because our entire lives are dependent on those banks. We need those banks so that we can get loans for cars, school, houses, businesses, etc. However, I do feel that it should be like a bank itself, the banks should have to pay back the bailouts.",-1
39,"Business go under because of flawed business practices, mismanagement, or just a lack of demand for whatever it is they're offering. They can either adapt or die. If the government bails out ANY business, big or small, that business will simply continue to do whatever it was that got them in trouble in the first place.",1
39,"If the government doesn't, a lot of people might end up losing jobs from the bankruptcy of a large corporation. It could lead to higher unemployment rates, reducing GDP, and eventually devaluation of currency. Example: General Motors, Chrysler filed bankruptcy in ?USA, people would've lost many jobs.",-1
39,"PBS doesn't even get very much money from the federal government we need to keep the high quality programming that they provide on the air. PBS helps many young minds learn and grow for many parents not able to teach their kids PBS has lots of great shows that without pushing an agenda help children learn reading, spelling and math skills. it's a great help to many and not at a high cost to taxpayers.",-1
39,"PBS was originally founded to produce programming that could not be found on other channels. That is no longer the case . Every night all night it's the same drama after drama . NOVA is now a joke were lucky if we get 12 new episodes a year. it's time to reign them in. The government doesn't need to spend 500 million a year to fund yet another worthless drama, that's what abc nbc cbs.",1
39,"The idea wasn't good, bailing out financial institutions that probably created the financial crisis, but nonetheless if banks fail, everything else fails. The bailout was inevitable because BIG institutions were involved plus international markets too. We borrow money all the time, the idea that ""we didn't have money to begin with"" contradicts what most people do. Borrow for school, cars, house, start a business, then repay.",-1
39,The appalling manner in which the BBC has conducted itself over the last couple of years since the referendum result is proof enough that the taxpayer should not be funding bias reporting. In addition to this they spend far too much time and expense promoting their own programs and now they are 'considering' charging the over 75's for their much trumpeted tv licence. Remove the licence fee and privatise the BBC. We already get adverts on the BBC anyway; just this time they will be advertising other companies products and services.,1
39,"Untold thousands of workers depend on the solvent operation at General Motors, and, given the precarious position of the economy, losing the liquidity that was represented by General Motors and all of it's related businesses the shock of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy could have had significant repercussions to the overall economy. Trade-off: Bailout vs Depression, I go for bailout.",-1
39,"The bailout just put us in more debt with China. Our grandchildren will be paying for it for years to come. With all the taxes we pay, we should not have to borrow from any country. Government should learn how to handle our money better, and stop bailing out other countries.",1

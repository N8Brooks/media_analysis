9,"this is essentially a statement in reference to monetary tapering vs. monetary stimulus, and I honestly think that we can take on a few more points of inflation if it's needed to get us out of the current slump.",-1
9,"As if it wasn't bad enough knowing that The Government was giving my hard-earned money to young, totally capable, but unwilling, and lazy, high school dropouts, I as a cashier get to personally hand out the food that those food stamps and WIC checks paid for to the young and lazy ""Useless Trash of America"" (as i refer to them). And I have to do so, to support myself but as a (let's call it a side-effect) I am simply Making more money to be taxed and given to the Trash. It is a horrible cycle, that I am simply SICK TO DEATH of. And as if this didn't grind my gears enough, I work at a very High-end (High-priced) grocery establishment, therefore not only are they buying food with my money they are buying expensive overpriced food. And not essential food like milk eggs and bread, Poptarts and $5 bags of high-end chips, and Sushi (Pricey anywhere) and then pull out their own cash (I'm sure they didn't really earn or at least wasn't taxed) In order to pay for their cases and kegs of alcohol and bulk packs of tobacco. Now I make no joke when I say I could quite literally go on typing ALL NIGHT, but I will end it here by saying their has existed a single principle since the very beginning of the human species or life itself for that matter that I STRONGLY believe we should follow today. And that saying is, as we put it in the South where I live: ""YA don't WORK, YA don't EAT!""",1
9,"People are getting lazier day by day. People I attend school with are on welfare because their parents are too lazy to get a low end job and work their way up from their. I can't stand seeing my check every month get cut short because people who are too lazy or faking disabilities are getting part of my money I worked so hard to earn. Now if people actually were mental then put them on medication so they can work instead of giving them free money. We are in too much debt as it is, growing up thinking I'll be okay, but I forget about my future kids. I'm sorry but some fat chick that has designer jeans, fancy fake nails and an expensive updo doesn't deserve free money because to me that's cheating all of us hard workers out of our money. My mother works for CPS and sometimes when I go to bring her lunch I see people driving Mercedes and fancy cars, driving up to collect welfare and I sit in my care thinking what in the world? It isn't a free check it's meant for people that need it. People need to stop abusing it.",1
9,"This country makes it so people don't even try anymore! We can't continue like this or we are going to completely cripple our country! If you don't give away free money, then people have to find a way to survive! We have to stop enabling!!! We are going broke too in the social security because everybody thinks they are disabled and stand in line for their money too!!! Have you ever seen some of the people who claim to be disabled? PEOPLE, get a friggin job and stop using the system. Whatever happened to the days where family helped their family members till they got on their feet???? We have lost all sense of family!!!",1
9,"The end of welfare would be the end of civilization in most popular cities in America because the crime rate would sky rocket. The increase crime would end up costing more because more police, prosecutors and jails would be necessary. Housing, feeding and maintaining a prisoner is much more expensive then just giving a fraction of that expense away now as welfare.",1
9,I feel that if we continue this madness the people are never going to learn and are going to continue on people like me who are making over 100k a year I worked hard in college and at my job why do I have to pay for a drop out who wants to stay home and get stoned.,1
9,"Allow one out of wedlock child on welfare. If pregnant with second, give her the choice of either tubal ligation at the birth of the second, or no welfare on that child. Government could easily afford to pay for procedure and come out way ahead in the long run. Does not affect civil rights--It is her choice.",1
9,"Welfare didn't exist in the US until the 20th century, before that people who were poor had to work hard to provide for their families, take on another job, and save their money for basic necessities. People on welfare shouldn't be able to comment on this website because they shouldn't have laptops. LAPTOPS ARE NOT NECESSARY. If you're too lazy to work then beg on the street. The government and hard working people's wallets are Not Your Baby's Daddy.",1
9,"Welfare should not be free money. Why can't it be a job based government organization? ""You need welfare, here's a shovel!"" Take the drug users and abusers out of the system and use that money gained to fund such a program. If your family needs legitimate help then I feel it is deserved, but by no means free. I work for mine, you work for yours! Sometimes I wish I was not so prideful and hard working that I could sit on the couch to get paid too. Well, we can't all do that... who would pay for who?",1
9,"My roommate is divorced and the mother has custody of his 2 kids. She remarried and had 2 more kids with another man, and divorced him after 4 months of marriage. Now this single mother gets 2x child support, $1000 in food stamps, about $600 in the from of a welfare check, and free medical. Now she is trying to get more money from the system. Never worked once in her life and is a bottom feeder.",1
9,"Why should I continue to work hard to pay my rent and feed my family when the government pays the rent and feeds families for free? Where is the justice? And why should my hard earned wages pay for it? My mortgage is $950.00 a month yet the government gives that amount and more to people for free. I go to the grocery store with my measly $50.00 to put a few items in my cart yet the person with food stamps has a cart overflowing that could feed several families. Again, WHERE IS THE JUSTICE AND WHY AM I SUPPOSE TO DEAL WITH THIS? BECAUSE I WORK? THAT IS A LOAD OF CRAP.",1
9,"Too many people are abusing this right and it creates violence just by having kids raised in the projects by heathen mothers who have not respect for themselves and teach their kids to survive off of welfare just like them. If they could put fear into people so they will be more cautious about having children, then they can maintain a healthy level of people who can be raised in a civilized manner.",1
9,"All the ""no"" votes are talking about supporting their children. Ummm, stop having them! their are ways to prevent that. It is not someone else's responsibility to pay for your inability to stop breeding like rabbits. If you cannot afford children, don't get pregnant. I really don't care if you are a single mother or not. Why did you have children you couldn't afford in the first place? Did you ever stop to think before breeding, ""Hey, what if all of a sudden I was a single mother? Could I support this child myself?""",1
9,"I believe the original mission of welfare was a noble one. However, it has been taken advantage of. People have learned the loop holes and exploit it. I don't feel that I should have to pay for someone who has no goals in life. My coworker has a daughter who has 3 kids, not married, on section 8, food stamps, and gets a government check each month. You know what? She drives a nicer care then I do! Not to mention the fact of free health care. When tax time came, she got 6,000 back and I have to pay 200. In the end, she has more spendable income then I do! I work 60 hours a week to pay for my family. I don't see why she can't do the same. This however is one example. However, this is just one of many.",1
9,"49% of Americans are on some sort of government assistance. When you have more people in the wagon then pushing it, you're doomed for failure. there is no way to end poverty, poor people don't know how to manage money. If you give a rich man a million dollars he turns it into 10 million dollars, if you give a poor man a million dollars he spends all of it.",1
9,"their is a small percentage of people that need legitimate help, however most do abuse the system. Many people will say that this is exaggerated but it is not, the truth is that welfare promotes laziness in able bodied adults. also as a hardworking tax payer, I am most upset about the fact that I cannot opt out of paying for this program. I am tired of breaking my back day after day working hard while these people line up at the store with their ebt cards loading two shopping carts to the brim with the best food in the place and watching them pay a 400 dollar grocery bill on my and every other taxpayers dime. A lot of these people eat and live better then I do and I work myself into the ground to make a living for me and my family.",1
9,"Why should I have to work for a living, pay insurance and drown in water trying to pay my medical bills when other people on welfare get to sit at home, collect a welfare check and go to the hospital and not have to pay a cent? How is this fair? I am so tired of paying for other people's problems when I have enough of my own. Why are welfare recipients entitled to a tax return. They don't work, so why is it ok for them to take more of my money. I don't understand this world anymore. The system doesn't work.",1
9,"Too many are gaming the system.In the grocery stores they buy better food then the working class people. We can't afford to eat good,but they can using taxpayer money.Not right or fair.Our country is going bankrupt.Why are all these women allowed to have more children to feed off the taxpayers. If they want 5 or 6 kids let them support them.Working americans are fed up with the freebies,all because they breed like rabbits.",1
9,"I have plenty stories to share of people who need welfare and don't know how to get it, and even more stories of people who don't need it and get all the benefits of welfare. They save on food, doctor visits, etc, so they can spend their money on nice vacations or expensive stuff like big flat screen TVs, nice cars, smart phones etc.",1
9,"Although welfare helps some people that need it, most of the people who earn welfare don't even work. Welfare should be for people who work and just need a little extra help. Has anyone noticed that most people just abuse the system? This is true because people just use the money to buy drugs and they drink all day. They should be working and support the family with food or just things that they need. I would be so happy if welfare did not exist. If welfare was gone, I bet people would actually go and get a job. Then this economy would be the best that it's ever been.",1
9,"Welfare programs encourage ineptitude and fail to make individuals responsible for their own acts. We now have at least two generations of citizens that have grown up under the welfare programs of the 60's - the result is a culture of people quick to blame others for their own shortcomings, fearful of change, and lacking self-confidence. A generation less productive and more focused on entertainment then anything substantive.",1
9,"The United States' deficit is very high. This will only get worse with time if welfare continues. Furthermore, a lot of people take advantage of the fact that they can live off of welfare instead of working. I personally know a few people who do that. It is so frustrating to see how people can just take advantage of our country like that without caring about the harm that it is causing our country.",1
9,I don't think that the government should be lenient with public help. I agree with WIC and FAFSA which is help for mothers and students pursuing college. But I don't agree that people should get food stamps and tanf very easily these people need to get off their lazy asses and find a job and pay taxes like the rest of us,1
9,"My tax dollars are not being put to proper use in the welfare system. When people on welfare are out buying air jordans, iPhones, and other crap they don't need. Instead of groceries, maybe a vehicle to help get a job. They should have to piss in a cup if they want my tax dollars",1
9,"I got my first job at 16. I applied to one place, and was accepted after the first interview. I am a lifeguard. My original certification class cost me roughly $250 dollars, though the cost can range from less than 200 to 400, depending on the Red Cross or YMCA in your area. That may seem like a lot of money, but when people on welfare are getting $400-$600 dollars a month, such a certification would be easy to pay for. I worked at a YMCA, which paid for all my recertifications in my time working their - and as I've noticed, lifeguards at my YMCA and many others in the area are in very high demand. At 15 years old I was able to save up money and pay for a course myself, relying on my parents only for rides to the course and back home to complete it. Finding a job in many minimum wage fields (I made minimum wage, but those who work at beaches, or state parks often make UPWARDS of $10.35 an hour and almost always work 40+ hours a week) is not nearly as difficult as it may seem when you look in the right place. In my opinion, anyone who is not actively looking for a job and finds one within 6 months, unless they are mentally ill or so ill/disabled they cannot do so (and this is CONFIRMED by multiple medical professionals) then they will be taken off ALL welfare, as they are taking advantage of the system and effectively taking money from those of us who make an effort to actually get off our asses before we even NEED TO and work.",1
9,"Why should I have to pay for the laziness and general lack of ambition of others? Actually we reward such laziness. If I am not mistaken welfare recipients get tax returns each spring. How can one get a return if one does not have a job and thus does not pay any taxes? We need to break the cycle of generational welfare dependency. Free and public education exists. Use it! Being poor is not an excuse to be ignorant! When generation after generation of children see that it is okay to do nothing and be taken care of we are setting ourselves up for failure. I am not opposed to helping the truly needy. This should be a ""hand up"" not a ""hand out""! If you receive welfare benefits you should be subject to drug screenings as well. We are too soft as a species. We spend most of our resources supporting and funding the least productive sector of the population. From an investment standpoint it does not make much sense. Why would one continue to fund an investment that repeatedly under performs or in fact loses money? This investment strategy would bankrupt an individual in a very short time. This is exactly the way I view the welfare system. A poor investment. Time to cut our losses and focus our resources elsewhere.",1
9,"So many people work so hard to support themselves and just get by. Others use and abuse welfare and would rather sit on their lazy butts and do nothing. My sister-in-law makes more money than me and she is on welfare and I have two jobs! She is overweight and so lazy. She has no desire to get a job and her lazy babies' daddy is just as bad. She wants to have a third kid to get more money. She tries to sell me food and all the items she gets for free in exchange for my money! She gets so much money a month for food she cannot eat it all. Yet I penny watch because I am having a hard time buying groceries, etc. She disgusts me greatly as do all the other lazy people who want handouts! Yes, I agree some people need it but a lot don't and are just too lazy to get a job.",1
9,"I am tired of my tax dollars going to help the lazy and unmotivated. I don't mind helping the sick, disabled and elderly. If you are age 18-65 you should have to work to earn any aid, such as food stamps, housing, free cell phones. I am sure the federal government can create jobs for those in need of aid. Let's get rid of the useless government agencies such as Education, Interior, Commerce, HUD, Energy, EPA, EEOC, USAID, National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, National Institutes of Health, African Development Foundation, and the DEA. Come on, America, wake up!",1
9,"Should I have an argument? Don't think an explanation is needed but if you demand one here it is. No where does our Constitution say I, as a private citizen, have to be forced to provide charity. Each person has the right to pursue happiness, it's not a guarantee. Only the delusional think that the Government has to take care of them.",1
9,It is unfair that people who wake up every morning and work so hard have to give half of their checks away to programs like welfare. I am sorry but I am a teacher in the Bronx and I have students whose mothers are younger than I am who DON'T work and collect welfare able woman who are lazy. It pisses me off.,1
9,"Welfare was not always around. Back then what were people supposed to do? Oh wait, they were actually hard working independent people. If you were poor back then, you had to work even harder to support your family. Why should I have to go to work everyday while other people sit at home and wait for their welfare check in the mail? Nowadays people don't want to go out and do something for themselves, they would rather have someone else do it for them. People don't understand that when you work hard for something, the feeling of providing for yourself is a feeling you can't get when something is handed to you. I work hard for what I do and I don't appreciate having to pay for some low-life who stays at home, and gets free money in the mail and uses an EBT card wherever they go.",1
9,"Put an end to welfare and you'll put an end to the debt this country has. Why furlough federal workers when all you have to do is stop welfare? Stop one week's worth of welfare checks and you'll save trillions of dollars and lower our taxes. Impeach Obama (who was never elected in the first place), and End Welfare Now!",1
9,"Yes. Separate off care for the elderly and sick. If able-bodied, work or starve. Nor is it up to anyone else to provide for YOUR children. You had them, YOU support them so no care for kids either. Open up orphanages or adopt them out, and sterilize the parents. Absolutely NO aid to foreigners of ANY type. Send them home if they can't care for themselves.",1
9,"And watch them use their EBT cards. The ""stigma"" that used to exist with welfare is completely gone. Ask anyone that was raised on welfare and embarrassed, someone who has turned into a productive member of society, to discuss how they feel about today's system. Their pissed! The Left has BRED a voting class. You think our politicians want to end welfare? Absolutely not, because as long as they keep doling out the money, these people keep voting Blue! Either end Welfare, or take away their right to vote. They're not working to better the country, don't let them decide how it should be run!",1
9,"As a teacher, I've actually heard the above statement. it's very unfortunate how those that are born into poverty never learn to break the cycle. We as a nation need to put our foot down and educate those that struggle. I've often wondered, why not require some sort of community service so those ""that cannot find work"" at least feel good about contributing to society.",1
9,All it does is drag down the economy and causes us to pay people who do nothing to support the country or the economy. They sit around and let other people do the work for them and steal their tax money to support themselves while just sitting around at home on their couch.,1
9,"Some may need the assistance, but their are too many that ABUSE the system meant to help them. Having children right when the benefit is about to run out proves that they are riding the system. Get a job, education, think better of yourself. You are worth more than assistance.",1
9,"1. Let supply and demand to their job. If you stop giving away free money, the cost of goods and services will naturally come down due to increased supply and decreased demand. 2. Giving people handouts does NOT help anyone, not even the beneficiary's themselves. Just think of a whining screaming child who doesn't want to eat their dinner, but wants the ice cream. If you constantly give the child the ice cream without first eating his or her dinner, then they will always know that they get their way regardless, and will NEVER eat their dinner. All they have to do is whine enough and they would get their way. I say give them NOTHING, because just like a child needing to eat, survival is a mother of a motivator to get a job. The reduced crime argument is illogical (by keeping them from robbing people). Most of them who are criminals would still be criminals with or without the handouts - they rob people anyway, and not just the taxpayers. 3. McDonald's is always hiring, so are many, many, many jobs to get you started. 4. The handouts are usually spent on drugs or non-essentials anyway.",1
9,"A democracy can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largess from the public treasury. -Alexis de Tocqueville We need to help people find work instead of just giving them money-that's what got us through the depression; government programs that created jobs-not government programs that gave free handouts. Also, if you don't pay taxes, you should not be able to vote. We are all familiar with the phrase ""no taxation without representation."" This is a double edged sword; I would argue that there should not be representation without taxation. What we have now are lazy people voting people into office that will continue to allow them to be lazy.",1
9,I worked at a grocery store through high school and it was common knowledge which customers bought food stamps from others. If you can sell your food stamps I am guessing you don't really need them anymore so get off the system. there should be very short term assistance for those who are really in need but this system rewards those who procreate for benefits.,1
9,"Sure, big government combined with a placid public are responsible for the ability to subject people to property taxes and inflation taxes, both of which make property ownership and existence more difficult for an honest, hard working person. Those whom are responsible must be held accountable in whatever way is necessary. Sure, it's tough that property taxes and big government's requirements of landlords and employers make running a business and occupying property much more expensive, inefficient endeavors. The tyrants responsible for the persistence of such policy ought be held accountable. But there's still a lot of room for personal responsibility to be taken and success to be had. As a culture, our emotional grit is severely lacking. People whimper out of getting an abortion, people are foolish and get comfortable with their employment. People get mortgages?! Can you believe that so many people are certain that they'll be able to pay a mortgage for 15, 30, or 45 years?! Stupidity. Moral of the story? Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Learn to hate your oppressors. Get your ass in gear. Reduce your fabulous, obese standards. Don't have a child if you can't provide for it. Recognize the sources of problems like the costs of living, and escape the rat race. If it's too hard, then perhaps you are best off being a martyr and giving your life for liberty. there are many politicians, bankers, and businessmen who are tyrants and probably ought be made an example of. Are you offended that I suggest you end your life? Then be offended that you are responsible for the society in which I considered doing the same for my own life for decades. Your life is your own. AND MY LIFE OUGHT BE MINE.",1
9,"At least cut the support in half for every child born while the mother is already on welfare when she gets pregnant. there should be penalties, not financial rewards for having children when someone is already on long term assistance. The Obama phone program needs to be shut down, it's only used as a tool to solicit sex and drugs. My husband shouldn't be ""yo baby Daddy"" just because you want more money to get your nails did.",1
9,"If the system aided those who NEEDED it exclusively, I'd have no problem with it. However, as long as there are those lazy/unskilled people who abuse this it's simply hindering us. The system needs to change and monitor welfare spending to ensure scumbags aren't spending OUR money for their next drug fix.",1
9,"I believe in the good old days. Where if you did not make enough, you would not survive. Not being rude. But if you leave it to the individual to ""fend for themselves"", then their will be a need for them to work. there is no shortage of jobs. Sure, the local McDonald's isn't the most glorious job, and you may have to walk their, but it's a job nonetheless. People need to start holding themselves responsible and do what it takes to survive. I am not sure when it was everyone's entitlement and right to drink, smoke or have an iPhone. It is not necessary and yet I'm paying for people to have them. It is not my responsibility to pay for others. I'm in high school and work 2 jobs 40+ hours a week to feed, clothe, and pay for all of my own stuff. If a ""child"" can do it, then anyone can.",1
9,"their is far too much abuse of they system. If I have to work, and therefore pay tax, then individuals on welfare should have to work for it - or perform some service that benefits society in order to earn the welfare. I see people on welfare with wads of cash in their pockets to pay for things that aren't free to them... Why is that?",1
9,"I am tired of working day in and day out in people's homes who live better then me and are being given it for free. I have installed TV on some very large flat panel sets inside of government subsidized housing for people eating free meals and getting all of their hospital visits for free. I then go home to an empty refrigerator, no tv, a mortgage payment, a stack of medical bills sent to collections and a nice little letter in the mailbox saying that I am being audited for not paying enough in taxes.",1
9,"That tool then gets passed down to the next generation, and the generation after that. The welfare system is scheme to prevent low income families from climbing up the ladder. You think rich and middle class want the poor moving into their neighborhoods? I don't think so. The upper class and middle class are willing to pay a bit extra in taxes to make sure the poor stays within their ""boundaries"". And welfare does exactly that. It keeps the poor, poor, and prevents them from climbing up the ladder.",1
9,"I have no issues with the working poor getting welfare. They have jobs and need help so they can make it to work in order to keep their jobs and move up to a hire pay grade. I support subsidized gas cards, subsidized housing, and subsidized utility bills for working people earning a salary that is at the poverty level. I have major issues with people who are on section 8, food stamps, and SSI that go clubbing 24/7, drink 24/7, smoke 24/7, and cause problems in their communities. Most people who commit crimes in urban areas are on welfare. The Boston bombers were also on welfare.",1
9,"I am a business owner, working seven days a week, 70 hours a week and still struggling to do things that people on food stamps and welfare are enjoying. I know people who are on welfare have money to get nails don't every other week, go out every weekend, FAFSA is paying for their education. We are paying taxes to pay for education and welfare for other people. I think everyone should not be taxed for welfare or education. If you have money, send your kids to school, if not then no education. Same thing with welfare. Getting your nails don't is not important, why can't they use or save that money for emergencies? It kills me that I can't get any help for my son because we own a business but the fact is that our business is not making any profits therefore we have to pull extra hours to save payroll. If public schools weren't free and we did not get taxed, we would have money to take care of our family. They should also limit the number of kids you can have if you are already on welfare. it's too much to see people enjoying life with our money.",1
9,"I am a single parent who does not rely on the welfare system. I worked full time and studied full time whilst being a single mother to improve my earnings prospect. My life has not been easy. I did not have children on my own. Two of us made a decision to have kids. However I was the one who was left to support our children. I love them dearly and would not change it. I could have taken the easy way out and relied on welfare but I decided to choose a better life for my children. We are by no means wealthy but what we have I have earned. I work very hard for my money and it really annoys me that I pay enough tax in a fortnight ($1,000) to fund someone elses welfare benefits whilst they have an easy life at home.",1
9,"The government wants to raise taxes so they can just spend more. A lot of money is used for things other then the designed purpose. SSI for instance, you have people on SS that have never paid a penny into the system. While that cheat ""the government"" through welfare. It is not the ""government that is being cheated. it's the taxpayer.",1
9,"I need my money to live, to invest in my retirement, to support my ambitions. I'm a single person with no dependents and as such, I pay a higher tax rate than others. Why should I have to ""go without"" so that my precious earned dollars can be re-distributed to those the state thinks should NOT ""go without""? I did not have kids I could not afford (I had none). I went to college, I work 2 jobs, I bought a used car, I live an efficiency, I save 30% of my income, I contribute to charity, and I put 15% of my income in retirement (15% on top of the 30%). I made and continue to make all the right decisions, why should I have to pay money to those who did not? I feel like I am being penalized for the mistakes of others... How is this American?",1
9,"Each state should run it's own welfare system, for ex: Idaho and Florida have different issues and believes on welfare so the programs should be different! Why should either party in Washington make that choice for all? Maybe they can set a minimum standard but no national system. Does no one else see it that way!? Sorry about my spelling never a strong suit of mine!",1
9,"I went to my local grocery store here in Texas and noticed the couple in front of me in line had extremely nice clothes. I supported myself through college and couldn't afford clothes like that working as a bachelor's prepared nurse with over 5 years experience. I noticed they paid for the food with food stamps (lone star card here in Texas). I paid for my 2 items really quickly and as I was walking out I noticed they were getting into a new Escalades that still had dealer plates on it. I asked him how he liked it and he said they were so glad they bought it, and raved how wonderful it was. Must be nice to get welfare and to be able to afford things that a lot of people with college degrees cannot. Do they need to totally end welfare, maybe not, but they really need to look at the amount of abuse in the system. I grew up in a town that was predominantly Hispanic, and when I was young I remember older family members of my Hispanic friends telling the older siblings how to get what benefits. Loopholes and ways around the system are passed on from generation to generation. As a proud flag waving American citizen, and a veteran also, it just disgusts me to see what this country has become. We have turned from the land of opportunity to a society of entitlement.",1
9,The welfare system has too many loopholes and needs to be fixed. Even a person on welfare can collect a tax return. their need to be diminishing returns on how long a person can remain on this service. Since the government is paying them they should at least do work for the government.,1
9,"Under normal circumstances, I might agree to reducing or eliminating the welfare program. However, in light of the current economy, I think it is imperative to keep all welfare programs funded and available for those who need assistance as the result of reduced income or total job loss. In addition, since the bill to extend unemployment benefits is still languishing in the Senate, the country will have to have some alternative programs or measures to help those who have exhausted all their UI benefits and currently have no income.",1
9,"Whatever the product, subsidize it and you will get more of it. This leads to the age old question 'What do we owe our parasites?' I say we owe them nothing. Let those who are kind and caring support them with their own money. The purpose of the government is not to provide sustenance to the lazy. It is time to pull the plug, sink or swim by your own efforts or private charity. I support my own children, and I highly resent supporting yours. End it now, for the children of the Taxpayers.",1
9,"The entitlement mentality established by our European nanny-state-style us government is harmful to the people in which it is obligated to protect. Welfare encourages a lack of work ethic and overall is not helpful to society. Giving my money to another citizen by taking the capital through my taxes robs both individuals involved. It robs the receiver as he does not get to see the care and generosity of his fellow man wishing to help him. Additionally, it establishes the mood that he is now entitled to weekly/monthly checks of the same amount for no real reason. On the other hand, it robs the giver of not having the personal interaction with whom he is trying to help.",1
9,"I have been a working Samaritan my whole life I have never gotten anything for free, and I will never live that way I was raised if you want something, you work for it. I think that there should still be welfare, but it should be cut in half, and have a cap of no more than 2 years. Meanwhile in that 2 years, that beneficiary should be paying that back to the community in some sort of way, examples community service, Adopt A Highway, volunteer work at an animal shelter, or even better yet, be on a registered list to the community 4 people who are not taking advantage of the system, that pay their taxes, and have them do household work, yard work, or anything that the taxpayer needs don't that will benefit them. it's only common sense that it is not fair at all to the working people to be taxed beyond their breaking point and have people just sit around and do nothing, literally do nothing, and collect a check and live just as good as the working people. And if there's a cap on government assistance benefits created at some day. Any and all beneficiaries should be obligated to pay back whatever they collected with interest if they did not help out with in those two years with community service and whatnot Exedra that I explained. Because the IRS does not let up on interest and penalty fees to the working people. So why is it fair and how is it fair for somebody that doesn't do anything at all to get a free check and is able to work. I want answers, and so does the rest of Americas Society. Because our government has not given one. Sincerely, Chase Brown law abiding citizen and taxpayer who is sick of paying taxes to people who don't deserve my money!!!",1
9,"Welfare is adding to more poverty to the USA!!! The only people who deserve welfare on a regular bases are the elderly, physically and mentally ill or challenge. The inner cities across this nation are being destroyed by welfare dependent, The ""get laid get paid"" system of welfare is creating an overpopulation of lazy, uneducated, and a lack of personal responsibly . I understand that sometime hard working people fall on hard times and should be helped to keep them afloat temporally. The key word is ""Hard working people"". Not high school dropouts who get pregnant to qualify for welfare and have no intent to raise their kids properly or just want the easy way of earning money by hopping on welfare programs. I know people on welfare and it's discussing how this program embraces laziness and the poisonous idea that ""It owed to me"". Today, more people than ever before 67.3 million Americans, who receive welfare benefits depend on the federal government for housing, food, income, student aid, or other assistance once considered to be the responsibility of individuals, families, neighborhoods, churches, and other civil society institutions. The United States reached another milestone in 2010: For the first time in history, half the population pays no federal income taxes.",1
9,Hypothetically. If you or I get laid off of work and have to collect unemployment. It would run out after a year and a half. Then I would be shit out of luck and have to take whatever job I could to pay my bills. So why can we make these lazy fucks do the same. Sure you need welfare. Well you have 18 months then there is no more. Go get a damn job support yourself,1
9,It is true that some use it and really need it but far too many abuse it. I've seen it first hand as a cashier and a shopper. Buying junk food and frozen pizzas by the cart. While shopping I had to wait in line while some ghetto girls tried to buy sushi and salad with an ebt card and were upset that they had to pay tax because it was a prepared item. They also had starbucks cover in their hands. Right they were very in need buying those. Take it away and work out a temp system to help those that actually need it.,1
9,I think welfare is not really helping anyone statistically 90% of people are scamming the system. My sister works in the public aid office and a lot of these people come in wearing clothes that are super expensive the reason they can buy those are simple they are lying about their income and taking whatever freebies they can get to support their lifestyle. I know their are working people on welfare but the answer is to raise minimum wage so people can feel good about earning their living rather then having the government support them.No one could feel proud about that.The government is trying to keep the poor poor by tossing crums their way People need to get educated and stop depending on the government your only doing exactly what they want. YOu are worth so much more than being made to lie to get some groceries,1
9,And military vets are another group of people dependent on Government Assistance. They get out the military and struggle to find jobs. The struggle is so great that the government actually rewards employers for hiring vets.,1
9,"I live across from a welfare family, 5 children, mother and father, the state provides elect. 3 iphones,food,clothing, new appliances, fuel oil, care payments,cigarettes, dog food, child care when the parents are too stressed to watch their kids, rent, new furniture when they wreck theirs, the place is a dump, trash all over the lawn, trash all through the house, the parents never clean anything they just go buy new and the old goes in the trash. What normal hard working citizen lives this way? The kids get free lunch and breakfast at school, free dental and the whole family has free medical, why should they ever work?",1
9,"Welfare is essentially handouts, designed to provide a work free environment while still receiving a living. their are a few that truly need it, but their are also bottom-feeders that don't feel they need to work. Ronald Reagan once said that we should measure the success of welfare by how many are taken off it, not added to it.",1
9,"Observing the people on welfare getting handouts I see lack of motivation to have a job, take proper care of their children, become drug and alcohol abusers, move to neighborhoods and run them down, infuriate working people knowing that their taxes go to these people. Our government is taking advantage and abusing the working taxpayer by making us support these programs that are more then not abused. Make people stand in like for basic foods like it used to be. don't make it so easy. there is no oversight on what these people do. Government just hands it to them and turns their heads. Furthermore, don't give any assistance to illegals. We have enough problems with our own deadbeats! Shame on all employers that hire illegals just because they work cheap. Why isn't law enforcement finding these people. They come to America and have child after child and are able to claim then and get welfare on them. What is wrong with staying in their own country and make it better instead of taking the easy way out and coming here not to be a proud American but to suck what they can from our hard working people. By illegals working for less money has brought decent wages down so low . Shame on you employers!! If they wouldn't hire them maybe they wouldn't come here. The must go through the process just as immigrants had to in the past. What makes them different? People say this country was built on immigrants. Don't forget the Indians were here first. So this country was seized more or less. And all immigration had a process to abide to. One was must speak English. Why do the ones that sneak in here now get the privilege of skipping that step?",1
9,When I was a little girl my father would always spent long hours working to put food on the table. He thought getting welfare was so wrong because people work hard to get money and then they have to pay taxes. And it's not fair people work had and pay taxes when other people just think it's okay to take their hard earned money because they don't want to work. My father and I always thought it was okay if a disabled person got food stamps because of disability. One day we say a disabled man who didn't have a arm paying for his groceries. Next to him there was a woman paying with Welfare. She was perfectly fine. She wasn't missing any limbs. Even at the age I was (I was about 8 years old) I thought it was messed up.,1
9,"Poverty is real, yes. it's a shame that the lazy are abusing the system and leading to families who really do need food stamps to have such a stigma placed against them. It comes down to a simple question, If a homeless person asked you for a few dollars, would you give it to them knowing they might be bluffing and actually just a lazy tick? Now what if it was $400 every month? $400 that you spend a portion of your life earning that you will never get back. So.",1
9,"Her and her ex husband are drug addicts. When i asked her she gave a lot of excuses why she doesn't work, she's just lazy. She truly doesn't care about anything not even her kids, tho she would never admit this not even herself. it's a shame people like her take advantage of welfare. I don't want to be closed minded but their should be breeding laws.",1
9,"I'll keep this short and sweet. The Federal, State, and Local Governments exist to give us Security, Infrastructure, Printed Money, Taxes, Education (not at the Fed level IMO), and to set policies concerning immigration, etc etc. Doling out money to the unfortunate or the downright lazy is not the job of Government. The unfortunate should be taken care of by the charity of others and the lazy should be put in their place. I pay my house note, care note, and along with my wife; take care of my three children. It isn't my job to feed your family. I shouldn't be penalized via taxes for someone else's poor choices or bad luck. I donate to the local food pantry, Toys for Tots, and prior to children gave time to the local community. I'd rather have the choice to give then be forced. Welfare doesn't work. The money is better spent toward education grants, housing grants, daycare vouchers, etc.",1
9,"I hate a damn system leech!!!! Lady that's my neighbor gets Food Stamps, HUD, disability and Medicaid for her and her brat of a son. Just recently got approved for a habitat for humanity house. She has never worked. My husband and I bust our ass so her stupid kid can beat on people's doors @ 4 am and get away with it.",1
9,Think about if you were a cashier. Think about all the makeup and cell phone cases and chargers you would be ringing up for people using EBT cards. You would be pissed too if you had to see someone getting part of your monthly checks because they needed money to buy beauty supplies and things like that. EBT cards should be used to buy things that they absolutely need.,1
9,"When I was diagnosed with Cancer at 22, I lost everything because for the next three years I underwent chemo. I had to sell my house,care and still couldn't pay off my medical bills. My hospital told me to go get help from the state. I went and was actually told ""if you had kids it'd be way easier to qualify"" I had cancer and was told because I was responsible and got free birth control because I was not finished college, I was being punished. I think they're does need to be a safety net for people in need, but their also needs to be accountability. People who need help are not getting it because it has been flooded with people who see it as a way of life. No one teaches them it isn't I actually heard women in the office bragging they knew they would get a bigger place as soon as this baby comes. Being irresponsible somehow becomes beneficial and that is not fair.",1
9,I understand some people aren't able to get jobs and provide for themselves but some people abuse that and live off of it. If you're too lazy to provide for yourself and your family you shouldn't live off of welfare. there are plenty of jobs out their. Poverty wouldn't exist if you went out and got a job.,1
9,"Yes, too many people depend on public assistance from the United States. Public assistance should only be used by people who really need help getting on their feet. Another thing is that public assistance should only be for a short amount of time and not their entire life. Too many people take advantage of public assistance and it’s time for the government to put its foot down. there are too many hard working people in the United States for their money to be wasted because someone doesn't want to take charge of their life and only want to be depend on other people’s money. As well as the government is putting too much money into this program, and I feel like the money should go somewhere else",1
9,"I have seen so many times people abusing welfare. They use the government check for stupid things. I SAW A LADY BUY LOBSTER WITH WELFARE. People get so much off welfare a large amount of people say ""Why work when I get more from the government."" I think we need reform at least.",1
9,"WE NEED TO KILL THE WELFARE LAZY fucks IF you CAN'T GET A JOB it's your FAULT FKING NOOBS THAT VOTED NO, if you're a lazy butt that lives off the government, go beg on the street. These ""welfare mothers"" are getting pregnant for more welfare!",1
9,"By continuing welfare we are simply encouraging continued development of dependent, irresponsible, self righteous people. Kids grow up in a home with parents / role models who are just as dependent as the kids. People need to grow up and learn about responsibility. When I was a kid I received an allowance and it was cute but then I grew up and got a job. there are too many people who are useless. For the people who are worried about the kids as I am. Make school year round and have extracurricular activities till 5 pm and feed the kids dinner before leaving for home. The adults who should have learned responsibility will place an emphasis on it when they have to feed themselves. I'm tired of supporting people with my money who don't deserve it. Stop being useless.",1
9,"Those who have not put a cent into any kind of funds should not be given money point blank. This is the land of the Free as in free to express yourself, one's own religion, and speech where in the constitution does it state take taxpayers money and give it to immigrants and slackers. You pay into the system and you hit a hard spot hey it happens this is why we have this fund get your feet back on the ground find don't WORK cause their should be a limit literally how long should one be propped up before you realize A. This is just a freeloader who doesn't want to work. B. This person is that damn stupid and cannot even flip a burger. We have a different program for those people that are deemed handicapped cause if you can't work you obviously either will not settle for a mediocre job just plain lazy or injured and being stupid isn't an injury a a lack of intelligence.",1
9,I wouldnt say to end it. But to drastically reduce it. Many of the people on welfare abuse the system and very few truly need it. But the program should exist for the single mothers and to supplement income. Why don't we start giving some welfare money to vets? Why don't we take the public housing and put vets that fought to protect us and sacrificed for us in those homes. Our vets should be fully taken care of,1
9,"it's understandable to need help when you REALLY need it.When you work a full time job yet you still don't make ends. But c'mon i've seen people who keep having kids and they know they can't afford them but they don't care. Why ? Because welfare and Food Stamps exists! And what's worse is that both parents don't even have to work . Why ? Because they can receive 1000+ a month. Working isn't even a necessity anymore. Just live of the government. it's your family, you make them,you feed them. If you can't ,then don't make them. it's not fair to others who actually work hard to earn what they have.",1
9,"Why do people get to keep having kids and getting free handouts. They're your children and it's your responsibility to feed them. If you can't feed them, don't breed them. Nowadays people rely solely on what the government provides for them without having to even try to find a job. This country is making people LAZY.",1
9,"Giving free money to people who even though they are low income families makes them rely solely on this benefit. I believe some even take advantage of this public handout to keep having kids knowing they don't have to work. worse of all, neither parents want to even try to find a job. If you can't feed them, don't breed them.",1
9,"it's destroying our country. Nobody wants to work for anything anymore. Everybody wants their share that they "" put in "" Americans today are lazy because they're enabled. People want to continue their job working at gas station and get government assistance. it's not a system For those in desperate need anymore. it's a lifestyle. Generations of families are staying on it. And it's the liberals fault. They say there's a strict deadline but there's not. there is no consequences for anything. Somebody will always take care of you unless you are a drunk or a drug addict but it's ok to be lazy. People don't dream anymore.",1
9,We need to start thinking about what we are going to do when the programs go broke. Once the majority is taking from the minority our country will fail. Those who depend on other taxpayers will be devastated; left in the streets to riot and steal to survive. The best social program you can give someone is a JOB.,1
9,"We need to admit that welfare was a mistake and bring back the WPA . I believe anyone who wants money from the government should work for it doing good honest work fixing our crumbling infrastructure. The WPA, started by FDR put people to work during the great depression building roads, bridges, railroads and let's not forget the Hoover Dam. It worked fine and those people could support their families and hold their heads high because at the same time they were helping their country. Let's do away with free handouts and put people to work and make America the greatest country in the world again.",1
9,"It is being used and abused as a way of life and not as it should be for people who has fallen on hard times. there should be some kind of limit of time that you can be on welfare. People on welfare are a burden on society and should be made to do volunteer work to earn some of the benefits they receive. their are plenty of things that could be don't such as working at hospitals, nursing homes, senior centers etc. Welfare was supposed to end poverty all it has created is more poverty, it needs to be eliminated or overhauled in the very least.",1
9,"I want for their to be jobs for people, the government shouldn't tax the hard working people which was the money the workers earned, it's not right to take money away from the people, it was the harder workers money that they earned, welfare should be shut down, there nothing good about welfare, just get a job and let that be the money that you earned.",1
9,"Those who use welfare tend to take advantage of the system, they don't know what hard work is and it is unfair to taxpayers who actually work. I would most certainly not want to pay for someone who would quite possibly take advantage of welfare, and use it so the individual who can actually work can sit at home and do absolutely nothing.",1
9,"Referring to having children. If you can't feed them don't breed them. Some decide to breed so they wouldn't have to go to work and continue to take taxpayers money. God has given great amount of people arms and legs, so there's no excuse in not even getting a minimum wage job and working your way up in life. Not everyone loves their job, however that should not encourage them to show up late, get fired, and live off welfare. Charity money should only be given to the ones that were born disabled to the point that no one is willing to hire.",1
9,"I worked my entire life and never received welfare. Now I am retired and my income is not that much. But I live within my means. I propose that welfare be available for an individual or family for one year. Food stamps, medical care, housing, free lunch for the kids and free day care. Free phone ( no texting , no internet) Also mandatory classes on how to live within your means, how to feed your family , what is and is not a necessity. Now the recipients for one year can can work and earn non taxable funds putting together a nest egg. Husband and wife each must work at least one job each. No job, no program . If they really want a nice nest egg, they could work three jobs or four However ,after one year, no more welfare, no food stamps, no free medical care, no free anything. And you can't come back on welfare. it's a once and don't deal. You can't get divorced or married or have a baby and come back to welfare and any of its programs. The free ride is over and hopefully you made the best of it.",1
9,"The welfare program is being abused. I resent my tax dollars going toward people that are allowed to sit home and not try to work and just fleece the system. Make it hard to get welfare, free medical and food stamps. Food assistance should be the old bread and cheese lines or based like WIC is where they can only get the staples and not candy and soft drinks!",1
9,"It would make a lot of the unemployed people go out and find a job instead of taking handouts. I think it would be a help, because if we didn't have so many lazy younger adults then the work force and the younger generations would benefit. The younger generations could look at it as, that if you don't work or finish high school the government will reward you in doing so with free non worked for money.",1
9,"More and more people are using the system. Why work when you can be handed everything. It is the downfall of this country. Have a child, get a check, have a second child receive more. Taxpayers cannot support this and are very resentful. We pay for these children when they young then again when they go to work. The government must make people responsible.",1
9,"I have seen people wearing the new jays and Gucci shirts with a Louis Vuitton belt at the store trying to flex. They fill up the grocery cart and act like it's nothing, but then they get to the checkout line and pay with ebt. Then they load the groceries in a some luxury care and drive off rubbing their hands together like birdman.",1
9,"It is the job of family, community, neighbors, church, to care for one another. Not a bureaucratic impersonal government. Government does not use our money wisely and gets no consequences for this. But worse, welfare minimizes the ability of individuals. Children grow up with little ambition because it simply isn't required. Americans are generous. We know how to care for those in need, and we can do it in a personal, hands on manner.",1
9,"there are far too many coming illegally to the United States Especially from Somalia, Iran, and other Muslim countries to sit on welfare. We can't afford it. The American public is being bled dry to feed, clothe, house and take care of people who don't want to assimilate into the American way of life or learn English. This is a Christian country, not Muslim. Although our current president probably welcomes them",1
9,This time I don't wanna bring the bible into it. I grew up poor and even had no food for days. Served in the military. The citizens of the u.S played my salaries. I didn't make a lot but I made enough. That being said I worked 12 hours everyday. Went to field operations. So that is very different from sitting at home collecting checks and being fully capable of working. That is just plain laziness. And I've been through rough times so nobody can say these people have it rough. there's plenty of jobs out there for people who can work. Yes they should do away with welfare. Cuz it is not helping America. The government wants you to rely on them and not trust God that he will provide. That is all the welfare systems for.,1
9,"Do get me wrong, as I know their are some who need the program, but as long as our government is letting businesses go overseas with meaningful manufacturing jobs then they will continue to use Welfare as a ""vote getter"" for those who abuse the system. Just like most programs the government starts they ruin. They are too inept to run any type of program without it being corrupted, plain simple truth. If you want to have a welfare program then turn it over to a private company, eliminate those who are ""welfare babies"", those who have been on welfare through generations...Same families...Sons, daughters...To sons and daughters. If you are on welfare then you are going to work for it...Doing anything the private company has for jobs...Cutting grass, digging ditches, collecting garbage, baby sitting in a nursery, washing windows, etc. Bottomline is this, with as many people who refuse to work, or cannot work or cannot find good paying and don't work YOU CANNOT CONTINUE TO FUND WELFARE...The tax base will no longer support those that refuse to work. Oh and one more thing Social Security is not Welfare but a fund which is owed the American people who have been paying in for years. It is not an entitlement, but earned and owned.",1
9,First of all I grew up poor and still make minimum wage and I don't care about making a lot of money.The bible clearly states those that don't work don't eat. Jesus would not support social programs of giving to lazy people but he would support giving to people in need. All the poor people in the bible weren't looking for free laptops or nice clothes. They need Food and necessities not stuff that a lot of people on welfare get. And no one can say Jesus would have gave to welfare cuz Jesus would be totally against our government today. As a follower of Christ I give to people who need Food. I don't give free money to people who don't need it. Proverbs talks about laziness a lot also. there's a fine line in supporting widows and children and supporting someone's nice care or nice clothes. And if you are not a follower of Christ then obviously you won't agree with this. And don't reply back with scripture that you think supports welfare cuz that would be a waste of your time and don't tell me the bible contradicts itself.,1
9,"Any system in which a man who works 80-100 hours a week lives frugally and drives a worse vehicle then a person who just pops out baby after baby after baby from a bunch of different fathers is a broken system. I don't see why I should pay so much in taxes to support useless junkies popping out babies and sippin 40's on a porch while they drive a brand new escalade while I drive a 20 yr old truck. it's almost as if the government is actively discouraging people from trying to improve their lives and their children's future by rewarding lazy and useless people who just keep popping out future democrat voters. I feel like those who work support those who vote, and I'm tired of it.",1
9,I don't think it's right that people can not work have a bunch of kids and get taken care of. They need to make people work and take care of their own kids if you can't find a job then you need to go into the army i think everyone should have to work unless your ill and can't work or you worked your whole life and your retired.,1
9,"whatever happened to the American Dream, to where you can build yourself up from nothing. That's right welfare killed it, I'm sorry yes that is cold hearted but I don't want to be FORCED to support someone else. If we do decide to have welfare I think we should follow the Chilean model to where your own money goes into a trust, that way when you do fall on hard times it is your own money that you fall back on and not someone else's. Trust me, unemployment would drop, and this countries problems would slowly go away.",1
9,"I'm from a lower-middle class family that has struggled so many times trying to find food for dinner or money for a bill that needs to be payed ,but not once have my parents tried to get food stamps or a WIC. They have worked so hard their lives and have gotten their 4 kids out of bad housing into a 3 story house in a private community. All they had to do for this is work. My uncles and aunts are all on welfare and depend so much on government help but they all choose to not work or to quit their job before it's taken from them. My uncle lives in downtown Chicago and drives a brand new care. He's worked in construction and has quit because he started making to much. Yet he has a link card that his kids refer to it as ""free food"". These kids will grow up using the exact same method that parents use. My aunt worked in a high paying job that was in a business distract yet she quit her job applied for unemployment and also has a link care. She is choosing to be lazy instead of working. My family still struggle with paying bills and supporting two kids under 18. I being one of those kids have worked 3 different jobs just to have my check become less because people like my own family have chosen to be lazy and not work and take my money for ""free food and money"" is unbelievable. Yes their are people out their that really need this and I am okay with that but to the ones that abuse this are no good and lazy.",1
9,Simple as it can be. If you can't support yourself you should not have children! Welfare has become a way for LAZY people to succeed in the USA. Get a job and support yourself first. Then if you have enough money have children. Welfare and food stamps should be eliminated! Especially for illegal's and no free healthcare as well!!!,1
9,"The founding fathers of the United States laid out clearly and concisely what the role of the United States government should be in the lives of citizens. Pretty minimal. While i know some people are hungry, government's job is not to feed them and house them. That is the role of charities.",1
9,"Welfare isn't from the government. It is from everyone paying taxes. The government takes from the hardworking and gives to those who aren't. Why should someone working hard to support their family on middle income status be taxed for non-public goods? That money should either go to generalized public goods like roads, police, fire etc, or stay with the family for their children's education, food, housing, a reliable vehicle.",1
9,It makes me sick knowing I have busted my ass everyday for the 10 years at a job I can hardly stand and my tax dollars are going to lazy Americans who won't get a job. Anyone can find a job. I loathe my job but guess what. It pays my bills.,1
9,"Let this be my public apology for sitting on my butt rent free, groceries paid, for a brief period of my life. I am a single mother working two jobs, raising my lovely little girl all on my own. Both physically and financially with no government assistance. Now, I've realized this summer that what I paid into 3 half days a week for daycare I could have very easily bought and constructed a human being from live body parts on eBay. it's pretty exhausting to work so hard so Mary lou can live rent free with a full fridge while after a longggg day of work I can sometimes barely scrape a meal together. Our government is so very f*cked in the way welfare is set up. Basically teaches you to do absolutely nothing and you have a free ride OR get a minimum paying job and most likely lose or have some assistance cut. there's very little room their. I don't know if I should blame the government or the lazy ass people that slid by in life while we work. Either way I strongly suggest you free riders gain some self worth, get your ass up, get a job and work for your own damn life! You might gain something from it. Welfare isn't going to last forever ✌",1
9,"Blacks are almost equal in what they take for welfare and yet only make up 12% of population. Cut it off after 6 months, it's not a way of life, it's a helping hand. White privilege? What is that privilege, to pay taxes for the leeches so they can sit around all day? Wait til the money really runs out....",1
9,"The majority of people on welfare get it because they are lazy and uneducated. They have a child to get free EBT cards, cash assistance, free rent which is section 8, WIC which is for healthy foods for their kids because they are considered to dumb to buy good foods for them, free phones, utility assistance payments and they can get this for as long as they have a child under 18, which is why most have 5 or 6.",1
9,"I work hard to make sure I provide for me and my child. I pay my own rent in full, food, daycare and medical insurance. Why should people who choose to have children sit back and have a free ride at the expense of hard working taxpayers. The system needs to be revamped and people should be giving up to one year and no more to show they are fully capable for providing and taking care of their children or face having the children removed and jail time. Just like fathers who don't pay child support go to jail so should welfare, section 8, and food stamp recipients. Just like responsible adults have to work for a living so should they. This is the American way!",1

Makes a good wage, but he installs a furnace for a family (capable of working) that lives off of welfare for free and sees a nice SUV in the driveway, satellite dish, big screen, nicer furniture then he has and I'm sure it is frustrating. If you refuse to work or nurse that back ""injury"" for the rest of your life why should you have nicer non necessity luxuries then someone who works 40/ 50 hours a week, plus is also on call some weekends?? Who decided this makes sense? Your better off not working at all then making it to the lower middle class busting your rear.",1
9,"You know every time, I hear a welfare recipient say, ""I'm the hardest working welfare recipient working going to school to get my degree"". I wanna puke! I came from a very poor family, decided to go to college at 18 and not screw up my life by spreading my legs, and actually paid for my own college myself. No pell grants or free money here! I took out private loans when needed, worked three jobs, had my own apartment, and still pay loans today 20 yrs later...And now don't forget the Cato report, welfare recipients make more than entry level teachers. As I am an entry level teacher..Totally amazing. Wrong on so many levels.. We real hard working people who try to do the right thing, go to school, stay off our backs and out of welfare, get screwed every time... Oh yeah not to mention, I do have a legitimate disability and don't receive any welfare..Yes my condition is on social security list of qualifying condition(look it up recipients on your fancy computers) ..No welfare here! No assistance here! Just plain old good american real hard work...",1
9,Most people on welfare are lazy slobs. They say their is no jobs thats a lie. I lost my job a week ago and have had three job offers. I have a high school diploma. The difference between me and you leeches is i will dig holes all day or lift heavy boxes all day. Everyone wants a nice easy job in an office and in the ac. I make $14 an hour and still support a family of 4 with $2400 a month in expenses. No welfare for me. Get off your asses pick up a shovel and work your ass off. I come home everyday tired and sore but my kids are feed and clothed. Get up and do something with your pathetic lives. We shouldn't have to support lazy people. And to the people who say crime would increase. O well looks like a lot of leeches will be getting blown away. Try to rob me or hurt my kids fastest way into a grave. Just shows how lazy you people really are. Would rather steal and kill then work.,1
9,"their are people who need it, who are disabled and they should be helped. The ones who use and abuse the system need to be taken off. I know a lot of people who get ssi and don't need it they refuse to work. I see lazy people buy whatever they want with food stamps and welfare money and still demand more. They think it's owed to them. I was born poor and I'm still poor but I have worked for my family. If you have a job and need food stamps fine I agree let's help, but if you don't work get welfare and food stamps, live on housing and get medicaid you are a plight an abusive stain on our country. Ssi is meant for the elderly and disabled not the drunks and drug addicts. Here's a idea government give all welfare recipients a drug test and start the elimination process.",1
9,"I see a lot of immigrant family's doing a lot better financially better than me living off the welfare system and working under the table, higher taxes to pay for welfare and the growing economy(immigrants family's coming to America to live off welfare and get free handout) while i struggle to pay my bills, health insurance, rent, care, food, and I work full time cannot afford to go to college and cannot receive any assistance because I make too much. Meanwhile the ones on welfare get it all, free insurance, free college, free food, assistance with housing and work under the table driving $70,000 land rovers how is that seem like a working system, how is that seem fair, how does this help the financial system the stock market, taxes. Frankly i'm fed up im gonna quit my job be homeless, because I work construction and cannot afford to eat to fuel my muscles to keep going, I'm losing weight from burning to many calories' from work, stress, and just plain watching immigrants doing way better than me and they don't even leave their homes. They sell the drugs they receive from the free healthcare for cash to buy cigarettes' and illegal drugs and alcohol. Im fed up and politicians and government lets it happen does nothing about it. Please help 4th generation working American/native.",1
9,I am a 20 year old young male thats in college and works just to stay in college and even with my checks from my job i lose half of my check so i end up with about 200 at the most every two weeks while i know people who are the same age as me getting a 600_1000 check just doing nothing claiming that their disable and do nothing but buy drugs with the money that us struggling college students and members of the working class pays for and it's getting ridiculous it does nothing but make people more lazy then what their already are. I can barely pay for school books with the money i get from work because most of it goes to the lazy. College is expensive and so are the books. Those welfare checks need to be given to college students for funds and scholarships people can't pay for school but we can pay the lazy for doing nothing.,1
9,"I believe we can all agree that there is abuse in the system. With that understanding we (our countrymen) have asked for reform, and it's met with hostility and resent. I work 40+ hours a week, I worked hard and made tons of sacrifices for where I am today. I moved 3500 miles away from my family so I could make a life for myself. Money should be used to help people, not enable them to abuse the hard working people in the country. I spend maybe $400 in the grocery store to feed a family of 4 because that's what I can afford, someone on government assistance gets more? And why? Because I'm saving for college for 2 kids? Because I have health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, 401k, and an IRA? I'm being a responsible adult and doing what I can to make a life for myself. What argument is their to end welfare? That our country will go into ruin because people will be stealing and killing. It will cost the country too much to keep order. THAT IS UNREAL! To sum it all up, the believe that ending welfare will create chaos is reason enough to keep it going? So you're okay with being terrorized by your own countrymen? it's time to take a stand. Get rid of welfare, come up with a better plan.",1
9,"there should be in depth investigations on the reasons people need assistance. True, everyone needs help one day or another but if you have been receiving welfare for 20 years and you can work then there may be a problem with your situation. The idea of only receiving government assistance for one , two at the most, kid/s is a good idea too. I recall hearing teenage girls in high school say they could not wait to get pregnant so they could move out of their parents home into one of the local projects. Sounds stupid but true. Then they would let their boyfriends move in and hide them when inspection time went away. Sad that these were the people barbecuing and drinking outside the apartments 3-4 times a week being loud as can be.",1
9,"I, too, work out at city clinic and see way too many people taking advantage of the system. A person who has Medicaid but spend $2000 dollars a month on weed. Families on WIC, but the kids have expensive clothes and iPads. It is starting to infuriate me. Now, I'm trying to go back to school to keep bettering myself, but I can't get government aid or even grants since I'm not taking enough credits. To truly see how bad welfare is, you have to work with the individuals who get it.",1
9,"No one deserves free money unless they're disabled or served the military. Welfare cannot replace budget and discipline. In my whole adult life i have always found a way to make ends meet without having to borrow absurd amounts of cash from family, and I always pay back with interest the odd time I did. My money does not belong in the pockets of some bum with an excuse as to why they're useless and undesirable by employers. Rather then go on welfare grow a backbone, get a shower at the Y and apply for a nights job while searching for a days job. If you can't afford kids on your own you have failed and they should be in a foster home until you can take care of them yourself.",1
9,"I work in a small company as a supervisor over many employees. I watched one of my employees in the check out in front of me one day by over $375 of groceries and paid with a public assistance card then purchased another $80 of cigarettes and alcohol. I was confused by this because my company pays her nearly $30,000 a year. So in bring this up in small talk this employee said they receive over $900 a month for public assistants. The reason she gave was because her five children five daddy's were not paying child support. I decided to turn her in for welfare fraud but was put on trial myself. I had to give my name, my address, my social security number and why I thought fraud was taking place and how I could assume that. I was asked over 50 questions and was told that they would reveal my name as the one making the claim. After some thought withdrew in fear of retaliation.",1
9,"Welfare to often enables poor money management, poor work ethics and increases the likelihood of continuing to expect others to help pay their way. Many of those on welfare have made poor decisions that has landed them in the situation their in. The best way to learn from making poor decisions is not to be rewarded but to have to struggle and learn that life lesson. No lesson is learned by the one requesting assistance, their children or those aware of the government assistance when they can't pay their utilities but buy new phones, Jordan's and ect. I see this abuse of government, state and local funded support daily and it enrages me to no end. How can you come in asking for help with a $400 purse and $600 phone in your hand?! That looks like you should list your valuables on Craigslist and buy your own groceries, utilities and rent! But nooo why should they have to sacrifice any luxuries to take care of themselves. I understand there are cases of true general need, with little to no fault of their own to need such assistance...But those are few and far between. Abuse in the Welfare system is the norm and it needs to end.",1
9,"Ending welfare is like a parent sending a child off to college or out of the house. I think that welfare people are a massive drain on society, they continue and are having TOO many kids who are also learning to live on welfare. End welfare, bring drugs and weapons to impoverished areas and let ""those"" people fend for themselves and die off.",1
9,Too many people are abusing the program. If we don't stop wasteful spending then we will ruin this country. We are currently reducing the budget of the Armed Forces with many threats occurring throughout the world. Why shouldn't we cut wasteful spending instead of something that will protect the citizens of this country.,1
9,"I am tired of working to see my taxes taking away from me. It was my blood, sweat, and hard work that earned the income. I was raised by a single mother who worked two, and sometimes three jobs, never taking a government handout. We were poor, lived in Apartments, and never owned a home. I have worked since the age of 13 years old, working through junior high school, high school, and then through college. I truly don't believe that anyone is entitled to a handout from the government. Most countries in the world live by the mantra of ""you don't work, you don't eat"". I know that their are people due to unforeseen circumstances, illness, Exedra that truly do need help,I am NOT opposed to that. But I have don't much research, and truly believe that the majority of people on some from of government entitlement program, abuse the system again and again. Women continuously have children out of wedlock from multiple fathers, only to get a larger check every month, never considering getting a job. I have been to the grocery store multiple times, where I see someone pull up in a luxury vehicle, hairdo, nails, jewelry, Exedra to see them use an EBT card at checkout, which makes me sick. The leftist libtards always say let the wealthy or well-to-do pay their fair share, how much of their share is fair? Just because someone has money, they most likely earned it through owning a business, taking a chance in an investment, or being an entrepreneur, why should they be demonized and expected to pay for the rest of the country that doesn't pay tax or lives off entitlement programs? I am 40 years old now, and refuse to have children, only to see the future of this country go into the toilet. I feel that this country's best years are behind it, and envy my grandparents generation, which got to see this country and a wonderful time.",1
9,"I live in the ghetto. My dad is on disability. He gets drunk every day and is too lazy to get a job. He figured out how to play the system so he can sit on his ass all day and drink. My mom works herself to exhaustion at Walgreens full time. My brother goes to medical school and works after classes. My neighbors party until 4am on an often basis. Some of the other neighbors live off of disability, but clearly don't need it, since they walk, talk and act normal. They walk up and down the streets, demanding money, and follow and harass women until we start a fight in order to be left alone. I lived with women on welfare. She'd ditch the kids and go out to clubs, and bring random men home. I would find used condoms behind my living room daybed. Another would use her disability check to buy weed and smoke every 4 hours, and when the money ran out, she'd bring men over and have sex with them for drugs and money. I think disability should be for real disabled people, not lazy people pretending to be crazy or injured. I think lazy people should stop riding scooters in Walmart and buying half the candy/cookie aisle and eating their way to disability. If people can not afford to have kids, they should not be making them! Many males would rather ride the bus or bicycle then pay child support around here, since the government takes away driver's license for non payment. I'm disabled, but unable to get disability, so i work as best as I can to pay my bills with my money.If I didn't work an lived off welfare, I would be so bored. People who live check to check, stop living above your means and stop breeding for handouts! I did an open adoption so I wouldn't live off welfare!",1
9,"First off, I was raised in a single parent household receiving government aid. I also experienced A lay-off that left my family with nothing, and had to go on aid. Am I glad that there was a safety net? At the time I was, but I soon realized that Welfare was a trap. People are taught ways to stretch the system by workers, and it disgusted me to see people at Welfare with the latest cell phone and brand news clothes. We were on Welfare for 2 months until I could get back on my feet, and the worker tried to tell us to stay on longer. It was ridiculous, I knew that there was a better way. Proof was in the pudding when I experienced another layoff. This time, we sold off all of our belongings: Jewelry (including my Wife's wedding ring), second vehicle, electronics and then I took on 2 minimum wage full time jobs to that we could pay rent and eat. We made the decision to get rid of our ""wants,"" and only kept our ""needs."" People try to act like it is everyone's right to have a cell phone, a care, air-conditioning, internet, and cable. These are luxuries, and if you are collecting welfare, then you should not have these things. I am not rich, we are a working class family, but my kids are happy and healthy. People did to stop depending on the Government and start depending on themselves.",1
9,"It was a program to help but now it's a program to let lazy people not have to do their part. It should be used to help those who do lose their jobs, help seniors keep their homes they worked for all their lives, to help our veterans cause they gave all. It should always give to the children, but not their lazy parents(who don't even work a part-time job). I believe that our taxes we pay should have a certain amount come out or things the government needs to keep running then the other percent that come out should be broken down into categories that the government wants to use it for and we check-mark the ones we want it to be used for: like programs to help our veterans, our senior citizens and ect. I would not check-mark the welfare program in it's currents state. I know several senior citizens who have had to move out of their homes that they work for their whole life to get because the property taxes were to high to pay with their SS- when they could of made the tax payments if they didn't have to pay the school portion of the taxes just the property portion. Senior citizens should not have to pay school taxes on their property (they no longer have children in school at that age). If they are fortunate enough to get food stamps they get 20.00 - 50.00 a month, but the 20 something year old couple next door gets 200.00 -300.00 and don't have to even maintain a part-time job! Yeh that's great. The program sucks. The only ones that should get it is the kids- they should be the only ones that get a medical card, if the parents need one they should have to pay a monthly fee for it. We have to pay taxes and pay for insurance and still pay for part of the bills out of our pockets, yet adults on the medical card get total free coverage for everytime they go to the doctor, hospital or any thing. Seniors have to pay for their Medicare out of monthly check and still have out of pocket and it does cover everything they need medical, eye, and dental. Our veterans should have to pay any medical, eye, or dental the rest of their lives (they served this country). Every city has state buildings that our empty and unused they should be used for free housing for our vets and/or used to provide ways for non-working welfare recipients to work off their welfare benefits. their is way to much litter laying around the world for their to be so many welfare recipients to not be earning their benefits.",1
9,"The welfare program had good intentions, however it sank into the moral decline of people. Welfare handouts are not strictly monitored and though some elderly and/or handicapped people really need it, for the most part I see abuse. it's a severe drain on the US economy and my tax dollar. The situation is only going to get worse in the future because it allows lazy, dependent generation after generation. it's become a way of life with no motivation to do better in life and just get buy on government/taxpayer assistance. And most definitely should not be given to any and all illegals. Also, the ""anchor baby"" needs to be discontinued.",1
9,"The government should regulate what food stamps buy, they should remove food stamp cash, they should remove all EBT machines from gas stations because they are abused. A person should have a time period to get things worked out and have to reapply if they don't.

9,"I see too many younger ""citizens"" receiving welfare in my neighborhood. Many jobs are available in the area. Every, every recipient that I know, has an Iphone, smokes cigarettes and marijuana, drinks alcohol and drives a vehicle. They also receive free health care, electric, gas and food stamps. They are given money for what they need, so they can spend their cash on what they want",1

I am grateful to my God, but I am also very proud of my hard work, and saving, and self-reliance. I too have been laid-off, divorced, you name it, but I 've always PLANNED for rainy days. Just use common sense, you don't need a life bail-out. This type of scrimping and planning used to be commonplace amongst our wiser forefathers. As a single father I try my best to raise a contributing member of society, to ""do (more) then my share..."" etc. So, yes, I do resent welfare recipients. there's way too many of them first off (by way too may I mean both the recipients AND the sheer volume of available entitlements). Secondly, I guarantee you that most of these folks do indeed live a more lavish life then me (that's not really saying too much!!). I see them every time I gas-up my (paid for) used beater. They're always their, gassing-up something much nicer and then take their vouchers inside for treats etc - all of which I choose to skip so I can make my mortgage payment, and fund my child's education - things these idiots are probably whining about not being able to afford. I see them everyday. So yes, welfare, like all things government, has become inefficient, bloated and counterproductive. The vast majority (and I do mean VAST) of welfare recipients are truly bottom-feeding, takers. End it now.",1
9,"A big part of the problem with our economy is the existence of the ""Welfare State."" it's really simple. Folks who are fighting hard to make their mortgage, raise their kids right, attempting to enter the middle class are the ones who are penalized by this ridiculous system. it's gotten harder every year. While welfare has gotten easier to obtain. As a single father who makes less than many of those on the dole, working 60 plus hours is just not cutting it anymore. I am grateful that I am (relatively) healthy and able to still do physical labor so we can eat etc., but working these long-ass hours, driving my care that I scraped enough cash together to pay for - it's really, really difficult to understand why those of us with jobs need to support anyone else in acquiring a care, clothes, amenities etc that I cannot afford myself. You can argue otherwise, but I can see the evidence all around me of folks on assistance, or ""living with their folks"" living more lavishly then me. - 45 y/o working single (tired) dad. Enough.",1
9,"it's no coincidence that pretty much everything wrong with this country, from violent crime to drug dealing/abuse to absentee fathers and the breakdown of families, taxes out the wazoo for those who work and are punished for it, etc, coincides with the rise of welfare. Idle hands have bored minds and nothing worthwhile to do, like taking responsibility for themselves and their offspring. That said, I notice that the majority of the people posting here in favor of the forced moocher system are themselves self-proclaimed moochers with boatloads of rationalizations to try to justify it. An attitude that they are entitled to a certain standard of living whether they earn it or not. It really comes down to one thing in the end: The only thing you are entitled to for yourself and your offspring is what you have earned and worked for with your own two hands. Obviously, welfare is not in that category. For those of you with 3 kids who just don't know how you'd get by if not for wonderful welfare, I'll bet if welfare had never existed you would have discovered this nifty little thing called birth control. Or welfare is what is enabling you to get a college degree? Hmmm. You could try working at a job or two to pay for that college degree and support yourself while doing it, like I did. Oh but wait, actually working at some minimum wage job is beneath you for (excuse excuse excuse), whereas people like me considered welfare beneath us. And right their folks, is the difference.",1
9,"Difference between falling on hard times (laid off) and making a career out of something. Good people that have fallen on hard times, I feel sorry for. The real problem are those that continue to breed. If you already have one child you can't afford to pay for, you have no right to have others. We need a one and don't. After the birth of your first child the welfare option needs taken away. Both parties get told up front, this will be the one and only child of yours that will receive benefits. Even if a couple splits up and children are produced by future relationships, they don't get covered. That would end plenty of this nonsense.

They need to start periodically locking up the deadbeats to make them pay or start work programs to enforce child support payments. They don't have money, so all they have left to lose is freedom and after a few lockups, they'll realize they need to do some regular hourly work to meet the criteria for their payments.

Also, the taxpayers that would be complaining about their good tax dollars going to waste would be getting their local roads fixed and expanding highways.

I don't care about what happened over a century ago to the native americans, Either. it's time to let that shit go.

I never say anything but she is just too lazy to do anything she could get a job but she doesn't she could work and make a living but she decides not to it is her fault she is on welfare.

I am sick and tired of voting democrat, Working hard, Me and my wife both, Getting ridiculed by Republicans who say I want free stuff (We make over 100k and get NOTHING) only to sit and watch lazy, Teet sucking white folks sit around, Mooch off of the government and vote republican and call me stupid for having a heart and voting democrat. Well, NO more, End it all, Throw those leeches and their kids under a bridge somewhere. Sorry I am pro choice but if you can not support yourself, You should NOT be allowed to procreate. I am don't being made fun of for being Liberal by these ungrateful pieces of trash draining my paycheck. If you are disabled, Get a job stuffing envelopes, I don't care.",1
9,Get rid of welfare in the United States. Welfare is a drain on our economy. Turned into a generational thing and it needs to end and that money should be put towards our national deficit instead of supporting generation after generation of people that don't want to work. And we need to stop providing welfare and government handouts to illegal immigrants they don't pay into our system.,1
9,"I see healthy people all the time with 2 or 3 shopping carts full of food or clothes at the store then they just pull out a card and it is all covered. I also think if they are going to continue with this free ride for people who know how to work the system, Then their ought to be stores just for them to shop in and it would carry good food but not top name brands. Another solution could be that if you are on welfare and can not find a job some government agency should work to get you one. I also think requirements to get welfare are to be extremely tough.",1
9,I think it's every citizens duty to help take care of their community to help each other and their family and herself but greed is human nature. I think people have lost a understanding of self and socioethical responsibility and they don't teach you them in school at least they didn't when I was growing up. But just because no one can force you doesn't mean be happy with being a complete douche your whole existence. But I think when we can get the freedom we've been promised and government gets in the correct lane and we evolve our economy or politics into a greater system on the foundation of liberty and people can take part in the free trade market like they should be able to instead of a cornered market regulated to a secret club only elites allowed maybe the people in our nation will have a chance to recover from the last 40 years,1
9,"Only dumb animals breed because they HAVE to, We should be above that. Welfare was set up for people who have had situations happen BEYOND their control.

AND, YES, I WOULD rather see their kids starve. Keep your sleazy legs closed ladies!",1

9,"We all know these antifa thugs and climate change activists are supported by government assistance programs. Do you honestly think a company would employ people who are this mentally unfit to work for them? Money is better spent to fund technological innovations, Not someone who doesn't know what bathroom to use.",1
9,"Yes, End welfare. Ending welfare means the budget would actually be balanced and positive. When the budget is positive we decrease debt. Decreasing debt means money printing is lessened. With money being printed less, We increase it's value. If you increase money's value you have more purchasing power meaning you can survive with less. The second step is to end illegal immigration and to limit legal immigration. Doing that will increase wages. Doing both will elevate this country to levels never seen before.",1
9,My money should not be forcibly used to write unaccountable checks to people who do nothing with their lives. If you are in a desperate situation seek out a charity. Seek out people who can help you personally. I'm a lot more generous with my money when it’s not being taken from me at implied gunpoint.,1
9,"I've worked hard most my life until I became unable to work. But, I've paid in. I don't like being on ssi and hang my head in shame. They only pay the essentials.

I know their are scams out their and they need to be weeded out.",1
9,"Opposed to what many other say, It IS because of welfare given to people of color instead of non Hispanic whites is why whites are declining. . Immigrants need to stop being helped. More white people could get jobs and at least try to have (and be able to afford) 2 kids per couple. . Without the brown skins here mixing with us and outbreeding us (which is a jews plan) America can become white again. . As it should be.",1
9,All welfare does is breed more need until all of us have no life worth living. Fight the fight against welfare now or we all lose our standard of living. Tent cities and decaying homes with less and less skilled labor to build is what welfare brings if left unchecked.,1
9,"I'm poor myself. I hold three university science degrees from ""excellent"" world-ranked research institutions. I still can't make enough to live safely even given my very humble lifestyle. The research I've looked at throughout the US shows that our population is increasing, Most of us are moving to/near the cities where there are survival resources And due to the demands, The costs of living especially housing are exploding. Yet still, We keep increasing our population. We can't even care adequately for those who are already here but we keep making more and more of us. Thanks in part to welfare. it's very frustrating. I've chosen not to have children because I can't afford it, Among other reasons. I have never been on welfare even though some nights I count myself lucky to have steamed rice or Ramen noodles. I scrape by, Useless university degrees sealed in boxes. It infuriates me that despite my struggling to survive, Never knowing how I'm going to make two, Three months down the line work, Others are rewarded for having children they can't afford. I don't care if it's just a few dollars out of my paychecks allocated to welfare. I need every last penny to survive. I'm barely surviving as it is. Welfare encourages people to have children they can't afford to care for AND I can't afford to help care for. Google the housing situation throughout the US--including once affordable Midwestern and Southern rural centers. The numbers of people competing for housing keep increasing so housing keeps getting more and more expensive. We have no solution to poverty yet we poor keep creating more of us. All because someone else is forced to foot much of the bill. Yet so many of us can barely afford to survive as it is already. Oh, International experts consistently report that growing up in poverty is the greatest threat to children in the West. What's our answer to this? Encourage more reproduction by taking others' earnings by force to fund others' reproductive prerogatives.",1

Maybe educate the people how to invest and save and work everyday what a concept.",1

9,"The welfare system is ripe for abuse and is abused. The welfare system creates a permanent voting base for those who cannot win on the basis of their arguments.

The time for debate is just about over. When the conversation ends, Violence begins.",1

Why should I provide for you when I choose to go without certain luxuries to live within my means. We manage our money, That we earn, And as such live within our means, Even if that means not buying the last greatest. Even if pulling from the scriptural command to care for the widows and orphans, That had to do with gleanings and not going over the fields a second time; but allowing the less fortunate to come back for the gleanings- their was still something that needed to be don't by the less fortunate there were no handouts.",1
9,"I truly believe welfare all government assistance to able bodied Americans should be revoked, If you're not disabled or elderly you should be about to get up get to work without having to live solely on the government the taxpayers. I was raised by a single parent who lost her job after becoming disabled never once applied for welfare, She was able to get her pension and has social security disability. I am her only child and I don't support welfare for people who are able bodied individuals that solely live off of the system. Most able bodied persons who live on welfare are a vast majority of single moms with multiple children and some of these people refuse to work a part time or even a full time job. Revoke the benefits for those who should be out working in the workforce.",1
9,"Taxpayers are paying for your mistakes; that is all it is. You had a kid too early. You didn't take school seriously. You liked to waste time. You dropped out of high school. You are at fault and other people pay for it, So it doesn't seem like it's their problem to pay for; you were just dumb.",1
9,"I shouldn't have to support lazy parents who spend beyond their means and have too many kids and illegals who only come here to live for free off tax payer money. it's sickening that people don't get that concept, People with actual disability should be the only exception to the rules.",1
9,"Welfare is the government giving away money, In order to get that money they need to raise taxes, Not only that, But if welfare is permanent, They they have no incentive to work which causes them to become lazy. This means that there are fewer people in the work force which drives up taxes more. It is fine to have independent organizations that help others, But not the government, The government is constitutionally supposed to defend and protect borders (executive branch) seek out justice (judicial) and to create laws (legislative), None of those things involve stealing from the hardworking and giving to the lazy.",1
9,"How many churches are in your neighborhood? Americans are the most generous people out of any country in the world. Nowhere else in the world will you see jars on store counters for ""tsunami relief"" or ""hurricane relief"" or ""raising money for a local child with cancer"". Welfare needs to be abolished and community churches can and will care for the poor, No matter what their religion or non-religion. Americans resent money being forcefully being taken from their paychecks but they will give because we have big hearts.",1
9,"We need welfare for elderly, Disabled, And sick individuals.

My mom worked in field pregnant and sick. We hurried picked our cotton and picked for other larger farmers to buy our school books. Yes we had to buy our books back then. None of us have been on welfare in Jail raised our children to work they are happy for it. Not happy for working for lazy people and immigrants. We love Jesus Christ and help the needy.",1
9,"I think universal basic income would be a lot better than welfare. Welfare might have a bunch of dumb restrictions that discourage poor people to work. With UBI people can get a monthly amount of money for free from the government, So work is always rewarded. I think that would be much better for getting rid of poverty.",1
9,"Welfare is much more common than you think it is. Over 1. 1396 Trillion dollars is handed out to individuals who claim to be handicapped or disabled (which is what 96% of that goes to). After me having personally compiled a list of over 1, 000 customers that have come in in the last year to a dealership that I work at and delineating which people truly need welfare and which don't, You come to find out that Latinos with recent or confirmed naturalization consume 63% of the welfare and are not actually per definition, Handicapped or disabled. 22% goes to Caucasians, And the rest is a mixture of various minority groups. The reasoning behind this, ""I speak and understand Spanish, "" is naturalized citizens know about our welfare state. They use it and take full advantage of it. I love the Christian responses. it's funny to me that less than 1% of atheists are on welfare and more then 34% of Christians are. This post is not to confirm or deny that any one group of people is wrong per culture and belief status, But it is simply a study I have conducted with measurable variables that shows an insightful problem that needs to be corrected.",1
9,"In America, When we say ""Free"" we mean free as in liberty. You have the right to freedom, (freedom of choice, Religion, Etc. ). It does not mean free, As in no monetary cost. It does not mean free housing, Food, Utilities, Money, Childcare. Please know the difference. Please don't bring a child into the world if you cannot even afford yourself. What has made this country great are all the people who take care of themselves and their families by working and teaching each generation about respect and a healthy work attitude. No greater feeling then getting paid for working and being able to spend ""your"" money how you please. When you abuse the system and receive welfare, You are stealing from every hard working and legal citizen of the United States of America. The Welfare System was created as a temporary means of helping people get back on their feet and becoming productive again. I am proud of our Government for finally requiring work/school/training programs in order to receive assistance. Unless you are physically/mentally unable to contribute to the workforce, their is absolutely NO excuse not to be a contributor to this great country. I believe in everyone doing their part, there should not be more takers than givers. It is the Universal imbalance that is ruining our country.",1
9,"People should required to give to get. there is some work that most current welfare recipients can do. At the very least, welfare recipients can report to a place where they must spend 8 hours a day (as most working people do) rather than sitting at home and reaping the benefits of the labor of others. I am not averse to providing temporary assistance to someone who falls on hard times. But unfortunately, we reward those who have children they cannot afford to raise by giving them more money for having more of those children. I have spent most of my 57 years living paycheck to paycheck and in considerable debt even though between my wife and myself we make a ""middle class"" income. We have managed to raise three children, buy a house, and stayed clothed and fed, though it has been a struggle. I don't understand why some people feel that they are ""entitled"" to be provided for simply because they draw breath yet make no contribution to society as a whole, and don't appreciate that which they are given at the expense of others.",1

Then to top it off they purchase a carton of cigarettes with cash. Cash they should have used for food. We go outside and they drive off in a new care, probably to section 8 housing. These same kids will received free breakfast and lunch at school. I can barely afford my own rent, food and gas let alone pay for theirs. I go to church and am expected to provide handouts for the summer to children who usually got the free meals each day. Where does it stop?

Democrats are so eager to remove religion from our society but they really should encourage it because religious organizations help those in need so much!!!!",1
9,"Reframe the question to: Should the government revise it's welfare program to require welfare recipients to seek part-time work and do volunteer work? Why should I and others have to work harder, and work more and longer hours, and give up our hard earned dollars to pay for the approximate 47 million people on food stamps, especially those who refuse to work, these are the ones I have to support, year after year, my entire life, through my hard earned labor, no time for my life, while these 47 million are paid NOT to work. Some are truly needy, others game the system. Everything is free at taxpayers expense. How is this fair and balanced? How does this give a person a sense of purpose? Or, teach them skills? Welfare is socialism. And socialism leads to communism. Honest work enables people to learn skills, to thrive, to give purpose to life, to enable one to feel the pride of achievement and accomplishment, to develop integrity, accountability, responsibility, commitment, and to be paid a salary. While their is genuine poverty in this country and people who are truly deserving of our help, it is time the 47 million that are mobile and able to work be mandated to seek employment and volunteer as a condition of government handout. Stupidity of certain elected government Senators and Representatives keeps the 47 million in endless poverty. And we the American people, through toil and sacrifice, pay a dear price. It is time we take a stand and elect new officials who are determined to revamp the welfare system and create incentives and skill-based training to get people into the workforce for an honorable day's work and pay and for all that one learns in the process. It is the people of the workforce who uplift the economy. And when they uplift the economy, they uplift themselves.",1

Most of the time, these calls are for non-life and death situations that require only a doctor's office, not ER/ED services. Yet, when asked why they called 911 to go to the hospital, they say, ""we don't have the money for a care or a cab."" So, for $50 dollars, not even the cost of our EMT's hour of service, we take loss after loss. And we can't reject any of these calls. I was a service clerk at a grocery store as a younger adult and so many times I see these bottom feeders spend my hard earn money on shrimp cocktails, $13 dollar cold pizzas, and all sort of junk food (like they need anymore junk), use their benefit card, and then ask for a $80 carton of cigarettes from a wallet overfilled with money that I'm sure was not earned. And then I went home and had Ramen noodle or 39 cent taste like a$$ mac and cheese because that was all I could afford though I worked 50 hours a week. I can understand quadriplegics and other bedbound people with NO FAMILY having access to benefits, but not that single chick who never worked a day in her life but have six screaming, unparented brats wearing Nike clothes that I cannot give my child because I work too hard to pay for their children. Hard working americans is not free if we have to be slaves to the poor. We are a free people, and we are all entitled to the pursuit of happiness.

The really sad part is if they are poor the government will give them a free ride to college but we have made it way to easy for people to sit around on welfare. I know people who intentionally work part time or low paying jobs so they always qualify for food stamps and medical cards. While hard working people can not afford their insurance premiums or the high deductible insurance plans they have. Make no mistake there's a lot of abuse of the welfare system. The only time anyone should be using welfare is if they are sick or have lost a job and need help on a temporary basis. If we crack down on who is using the welfare system maybe, people will start thinking about how many children they are popping out that they know they are not able to care for.",1

The most expedient thing to do is provide assistance, or institute a work program or mandate some tire of service: military or other government work.

Our economy would be growing at or faster then these other countries that are growing at 5 or 6 percent if we took welfare. People do what they have to, to survive.

9,"White taxpayers are paying for themselves to be replaced by third world immigration where genetic IQ levels are substantially lower. The middle class is of course hit the hardest, as they get zero government compensation and are arguably the hardest hit, along with higher earners who don't abuse loopholes. What happens when you drain the middle class into nothing? Socialism, communism, war and mass poverty. It is too open to abuse, so of course people will abuse the system and milk as much as they can from the taxpayers. The welfare state has to end or we are going to sink eventually. Transferring earnings from natives to non-natives, from people who love this country to people who want to abuse this country for resources, from people who work hard and try to continue the system we have here from people who don't even care to learn our language. It has to end, period.",1
9,Successful businesses should not require handouts. They have profits to secure their futures. If they paid and were successful enough they would not be in need of tax loopholes or government subsidies aka government corporate welfare. End welfare for these billion and millionaires. End their welfare right now.,1
9,"Who pays for welfare? Taxpayers of course. The government is forcing us to pay for welfare. The upper class pays an unproportional amount of taxes, and so the rich pay the most for welfare. This should not be the case, for receiving money is not a human right that the government should provide. People don't deserve to get free stuff just because they exist. The whole point of capitalism is that people earn their place in the world through what they can provide to society, and thus prove to be helpful to society. Capable people tend to rise to the top while incapable people sink to the bottom. This is logical since capitalism favors capability, whether that is defined as intelligence, strength, ect. Though harsh sounding, society doesn't need incapable individuals. A parallel can be drawn to how slower antelopes get killed off by the cheetah. For our case, poverty. Capitalism is result of limited government intervention of the economy, it is the natural order of how trade in this world works. To illusion ourselves that through advancement we can create a perfect utopia is often the source of how a dystopia occurs. All attempts to implement communism and socialism have not succeeded, an welfare is a major part of what makes such concepts. Side note: communism and socialism are very similar in nature and both occurred or were popularized by Marx. To make the argument that we should help people in need does not justify socialism. If the individual wants to help poor people, he or she or whatever pronoun they prefer can simply donate to charity on their terms. To force people to do so is a violation of freedom. For it is a government 'service' that is not a necessity for the basic running of a country, unlike security or courts. People who have money earned their money legally through our system. If they earn it illegally, it is up to the government to crack down on those people, but that should not factor into a common notion that the rich and elite should not have their money. It is also a right to pass down money to your children, and so while wealthy second generations did not earn their money, it is a result of the right to pass down wealth and therefore they have the right to keep their money. Whether they build on to that or waste it all is up to them. To take money away from them and shove it to poor people and to think that this helps with any issue like poverty in the long run is simply wrong. Poverty is an unavoidable symptom of human organization. If people want to give to the poor out of their private funds or create programs to help the poor, good for them. I personally believe in small government. Beyond requiring funds for basic tasks of running a country, the government needs to stay out of the way. Bureaucracy is never efficient.",1
9,"If you can and need to work you must work or suffer morally. Those that can't work have in the past, before welfare, received help from relatives and charities. So welfare created a problem that didn't really exist. Getting rid of welfare will force able people to work and those that can't work will cause charities to rise to their needs. This will greatly lower taxes and free up money that taxpayers can use to create jobs and donate to charities. It is a pretty obvious formula but Democrats need the welfare vote and welfare recipients don't want to work so we are stuck in a dilemma.",1
9,"I hate it when I see these slobs in town. Since I've been around their environments, time to share what I've learned. Most on Section 8 are frauds who are able to work. Easiest way is to go homeless. This doesn't mean in rags and street. You could not own property or be on a lease. Stay with friends or family. However a shelter stay can help. They're many contacts who can put you in touch with a doctor (paid by Medicaid) that will get you signed up for disability easily. Just complain about your life enough. there's free legal, tax dollar or volunteer agencies, to help you get on welfare too! Anxiety is a disability now! The normal anxiety we all face having to deal with the hassle of other people at our jobs. The depression of knowing they're dead end, low pay, and bad living conditions. You can get on welfare thru that too. I hate the whole ""I'm depressed. So I'm disabled. I deserve welfare."" What they're actually doing is holding the government hostage with their own life! Think about that. It boils down to they want to quit at life... So the government lets them quit at life!? What if we all quit because it's too hard? Who would pay for who. it's like saying ""Give me money or I'll kill myself!"" That's a big, NO! You should not be able to ransom yourself like that. But that is exactly what people are doing. Section 8 pays your rent at a place that accepts it and average for the area. Doesn't have to be someplace filthy. Finding an upper scale area that accepts it can be troublesome but people do it all the time. The government will pay the majority. Leaving $25 (Most) - $150 (Highest found). Food Stamps. Around here it's, for a single person not working. So when these welfare people are fat pigs. it's due to laziness not ""can't afford healthy food"". Yes, you can eat healthy with that much! SSI = Welfare. Not to be confused with SSI = Social Security Income. Around here they like to mix words and call Welfare as ""Supplemental Security Income"". That's bullshit to confuse the politics of it. Call it what it is, Welfare! Social Security Income Disability comes from Social Security funds. Welfare comes from US Treasury. So they play the game of calling SSI as the other SSI. So when people hear any plans of SSI being cut they can get those in social security up in arms to help defend their welfare too. Have to love politics! To get on SSI Disability takes a lot more than it does Welfare. The big factor being you have to put in work time earned and stricter medical rules. The worst part is that if they are on Medicaid for more than a year due to welfare disability. They can get enrolled in Medicare. Thanks for stealing money from old folks, scum.",1
9,"It definitely needs to be restricted to those seriously in need. Gas stations and fast food places shouldn't be acceptable places to shop if you're on welfare. You can use a computer for free at your local library to apply for jobs. Also Goodwill and others offer job placement and training all for free. If you are truly disabled, obviously you should receive assistance. But we have some seriously lazy, unmotivated people out their that are perfectly fine with getting their monthly check. Guys covered head to toe in tattoos, smoking weed, playing video games all day... And women who are getting with them to pop out baby after baby... How is this my responsibility to pay for their food, housing (which they almost always destroy anyway), their healthcare, smartphones, etc? People say ""what would Jesus do?"" LOL. He'd say get off your butt and get a job! These aren't lepers, these are perfectly able bodied adults!!",1
9,"After two fatherless children a person should be removed from welfare. If the person continues to have children they can't afford. Time to ""STOP"" having children.

Not just American that are born her but other people who come here and not citizen ( Specially) !!!!These people. A person from another COUNTRY should not be able to get any type of government assistance for at least two years or more.

9,"The system does work sometimes, but not enough. it's not working the way it's supposed to, which is to get people back on to their feet, not something that allows high school dropouts to do nothing.

9,"State parks put up signs about not feeding the wild life because the animals might grow to become dependent on humans for food. Likewise take a good look at what has become of our country as a result. We have baby momma's pumping out kids, often times by more than one man, at the expense of those of us who actually work in order to build a family. Whatever happened to taking responsibility for your own actions, living within your means and raising a family responsibly when you are financially able to do so? And to top it off, many of these same people don't get with anyone who will be a good role model for their kids. This leads to children growing up in broken homes, being raised by adult children who are completely unfit to be parents and who are now teaching their children by example to be just like them which in turn both perpetuates and exacerbates the problem. I understand there are exceptions in which people truly NEED help, but these same people should not be having families at the taxpayers expense without first having taken responsibility for their own lives. Follow the logic back to the source and examine what the system has produced. it's not rocket science to see the welfare system needs to be abolished. I live paycheck to paycheck.",1

9,"The average american works 34.4 hours a week at minimum wage making around 15,000 a year. That's not much compared to the 100,000 dollars a doctor might make annually. If the government takes money from a hardworking person with a lower paycheck it puts them that much closer to the poverty line, to pay for another person to lazy to get a job. I understand that some people legitimately need this money but most people on welfare don't have jobs and just sit around eating the potato chips their welfare checks pay for.",1
9,"My biological mother lives on welfare. She sits around all day and does nothing to try to improve her life. All she does is depend on the Welfare checks to support her and the people she lives with.

We don't work hard for our money just to hand it down to people who are milking us for every penny we have.",1
9,"Everyone has misfortune and needs the occasional hand up. Family, friends, church and charity should be the main channels of help. Government assistance should be used also but only to for a short term aid. If we set limits either by time or amount of benefits, it would give incentive for the leeches to get their act together and become productive and responsible members of society. If the US had a lifetime maximum of 1 year on welfare or equivalent maximum benefit and then a cut off, there would be definite changes in people's lifestyles which contribute to their economic misfortune.",1

I have yet to run into those who actually need it IE can't work, sincerely disabled, etc. I'm sure they are out their but I haven't met them.

9,"I have worked my ass of since I was on my own at 16. No one gave me welfare or any handouts. I had ONE son at the age of 18 and I never had another child because I don't feel it is my right to ask other people to pay for my son and I to exist. Why should I live off “other people’s money”, what gives me the right to expect welfare? Instead, I focused on providing a loving, safe and decent home for my ONE child. I worked crappy jobs and was treated like shit but it was worth it. I am sick of working hard and paying taxes for a whole generation of people who are too lazy and degenerate to get off their ass and get a job. Repeatedly, we see cases of women having multiple children for the money and then they try to get their own young daughters to get pregnant to have a kid when the checks are on the verge of drying up. Sick! I had a difficult childhood and understand that hard times fall on many of us but welfare was supposed to be TEMPORARY. Not a long-term solution meant to support generation after generation. When my son was in middle school he used to get teased for getting good grades by a certain race of people who said they wanted to go on welfare so they didn't need to try hard at school. In response to you so called Christians, Jesus NEVER advocated continual handouts. He said to ""teach a man how to fish"" so he could be reliant upon himself for food! This world is survival of the fittest. If generation after generation knows they will never have to get a job and Illegal Aliens come over just for free handouts we will fail as a nation. Our streets are violent, prisons full, homeless everywhere. Why? Children are abused and neglected in record numbers in our country and most are on some from of welfare as children. If people on welfare actually LOVED their first child, they would not have another until they could provide the basic necessities required to raise another child. Furthermore, I think we should require an application to become a parent and no one should ever get welfare for more than ONE child and it should be TEMPORARY. NO IMMIGRANT should ever get free handouts. You cannot go to other countries and expect them to give you money just because you breathe the air. I may sound harsh and uncaring but we have a real problem with overpopulation and degeneration around the globe. Look at the failures in the third world. They are dependent on handouts, yet they keep having babies they cannot feed. America is no exception! Unless we stop perpetuating the problem by letting people have unlimited babies and get money/food/clothes/cell phones/tv’s for doing absolutely nothing then America will run out of “other people’s money” and we will be nothing.",1

If people are going to have children, they must pay for them. No way should we pay for someone's child.",1
9,Just because we are shared citizens of a country does not oblige anyone citizen to financially support another. It is reprehensible of our government to order hard working citizens to contribute portions of their hard earned income to support others. That support should come from family and yet still is not a moral obligation even for them. It is sad and unfortunate that not everyone can support themselves but in no way should a portion of the population be forced to support others.,1
9,If you need to keep up with the Jones' you need to get it don't honestly. Welfare is government sponsored slavery. People that can work but won't are slaves to the welfare system. What will they do when the government cuts them off. And believe me- it's gonna happen. They will be rioting in the streets. Killing honest hard working people and looting their homes and think they have a right to it. A good many will die. I'd rather work and have what I need then beg or steal.,1
9,No one should be able to live above their means if you can't afford it then you shouldn't have it. Why people feel they are entitled to this is beyond me I have family that's on it if they couldn't afford it they could get help from other family and well if you don't got family that will help you then maybe you should have made a better impact on their life.,1

Nowadays, those in need use those stamps to sell them so that they can get drugs and/or alcohol beverages. I understand that their are children in need, so the government should support kids in need so that they can eat real food, and get a real education with active minds. And i also understand those that are on welfare who are working hard. They deserve the right to live a good life, but those that beg and sell, it's a waste of money. About 16 % of the population is either living a poor lifestyle or are on the streets, using stamps to get drugs or food. This is why we need a different type of welfare, for those who are avidly searching for work or are currently working and struggling to stay afloat. I have experienced the streets of north Las Vegas, and i would wish that on no one, but if people are lazy, they shouldn't be supported because they chose that path",1

9,"The Great Abe Lincoln once said. ""You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they can and should do for themselves."" The people on welfare will never be free. As soon as they become dependent, they are stuck their. They forget and no longer care to find a job. This is my opinion. However, I will soon be doing a position paper on the topic and plan to find out the pros and cons of each. I don't want to hate on anyone or any group. I'll start by telling a quick anecdote. My father worked or a concrete company for many, many years until they laid him off for months. He applied for unemployment. Once he was introduced into the program, he found that it was difficult to leave. Unemployment and welfare are two different things, but still similar. It is in his and my opinion that welfare may very well be a trap. This is all controversial of course... But think of it this way... A stray/wild cat comes around your house that is pretty cute, so a you go into the house to get some food because you really like this cat. You come back out and give it food and water. You do this three times a day every day of the week. What will the cat do? The cat will start becoming less independent. It will stop hunting for food. It will come around your house everyday for food and water. Eventually, you will have this cat right where you want him, so you decide to finally bring him into your own house. The cat is now totally under your control and entirely dependent on your food. This may seem pretty weird... But it makes sense. It gives the government more power over the people. It traps people. Especially if you are born into a welfare receiving family, the likelihood that you will receive welfare is much higher. Maybe that's all too far... But the thing that bothers me about welfare is the many people who are entirely capable of working that don't work. I agree, people who are entirely incapable of work should be allowed welfare of some sort. But don't tell me that 35% of people in the United States are incapable of some sort of work. My mother worked with the mentally handicapped, and they were amazing people. They all had jobs. don't tell me you cannot work. I appreciate the men and women on welfare that really work hard. Things will turn up for the better if you continue to work hard.",1

I once spent two months on food stamps back in the 80's back when they were ""food coupons"" not these credit card EBT deals of today. I did laundry in the bathtub because I didn't have quarters, I didn't have money for anything. It was humiliating and I ended up with a couple really horrible jobs but I worked and made it. The motivation to avoid the humiliation and stop being poor should be plenty of motivation for these welfare lifers. I'm not from a rich family and even today I have over $100k in school loans yet to pay. No deductions, not married, no kids, make too much to deduct my student loan interest, house paid off. I'm totally screwed every year at tax time. Enough already with the welfare state, people living 20+ years in subsidized housing having multiple kids they can't afford. Put a two year limit on welfare and that's it. Get your act together and stop penalizing the rest of us who are responsible.",1

9,"I admit it. I am part of the problem. Over the years I have donated tens of thousands of dollars to my church, and supported countless programs to raise up the weak and the poor. their is a good reason why they tell you not to feed wild animals.

I once had an idea in my head of the type of person I was supporting, raising someone else up. But I just end up handing out food to the same people every week; a young, strong, unmotivated culture that has no interest in bettering themselves. Our food drives go to feed the welfare state who trade their food stamps in 2-1 for dollars so they can buy alcohol and tobacco, rather then putting food in their own children's mouth. Out backpack drives go to put school supplies in the hands of young single mothers of multiple children, who spend money on overpriced junk food and waste, rather then putting the tools in to the hands of their own children so that they can have a better life than them. You and I created this problem. And we continue to feed this cancer society. Doubt me?

9,"Stop it already!! Food stamps, checks, phones, housing, insurance this is getting ridiculous. If you want it go get it. Your hungry kill something and cook it. Need shelter, build it, the woods have everything you need. Phones not a necessity . Insurance people made it before it was around. Free money that's just ludicrous. People have become dependent on the government and society. Im fed up with it all. What all these people think they need are just luxury items. Some say crime rate will go up. So that means we should submit. I don't think so! These people are the problem with america.",1
9,To many lazy people with to much time on their hands. They have to much time so they time to have babies they cannot support on their own. They have to much time so they can protest and compline and start trouble. Make lazy loafers support their own families and support themselves. I am sick and tired of paying taxes to support lazy people and their families.,1
9,Need competition for advancement of society. Why subsidize the week and lazy at the expense of my family. If they cannot feed their children then their children starve. If people feel so inclined to help then let them donate their own money and time. I would be willing to bet that most would find gainful employment if their very survival depended on it. And shouldn't it be their extended families responsibility before the governments?,1
9,"In 2013, almost 110 million americans were on some sort of welfare. While some people genuinely need it, many people just see no need to work, because they get the same money doing nothing as they would working a low end job (because that's all most people on welfare would get), and spend hard workings people's money to support people who do literally nothing.",1
9,"I was brought up by a single mother who at times worked hard to take care of us however in the end she found it easier to fall back on the government. I never understood how wrong it was until I grew up and became a single parent myself. I started my own business and bought a house in the hood then continued working hard and got my kid out of the hood. My whole adult life me and my kid could not afford to go to the doctor yet people who refuse to work get food stamps ,medical and bills paid it's ridiculous. Go to any bar near any projects I'll see where your tax dollars are being spent .",1
9,"I work at a store in a neighborhood surrounded by section 8 and low income housing. I see first hand every day what a joke our welfare system really is. So many people who are more than capable of finding a job and contributing to society choosing not to. Why? Because they get way to many government handouts. It really pisses me off to be honest. I mean why work when you can get a free phone, free internet, free housing, free utilities, free food, free transportation, I mean really free everything. Oh and the more babies you have, the more food stamps you receive. I see people selling their food stamps for half the face value all the time. This is crazy!! The truth is that the system is broken. The government hears everyone's pathetic little story about why they need this and they need that for free and says ok here you go. Now vote for me! The truth is nothing should be giving out for free. You should only receive what you have put in. Welfare should be a temporary solution and not a way of life. it's costing taxpayers way to much money. Our infrastructure sucks, education sucks, our overall economy sucks. But welfare is flourishing. Be glad Im not president cause this would end now. And truthfully, the country would become stronger as a result",1
9,"Welfare benefits should only be available to the needy elderly disabled citizens. Otherwise, welfare is an enabler for abusers. If people who want to breed, they need to be responsible for their action. it's not the public's responsibility to raise your family. it's yours and yours only. Every action has a consequence. Be responsible for your own action. If you can't feed, then don't breed.",1
9,"The current polls suggest 1 in every 7 citizens are utilizing government welfare service and aid. To me that means that there are 6 of those 7 that can help people individually without the government intervening. We don't need a government to force us to do something when we can help the people that are really in need. their are people that abuse the system of course, but their are people who do need help. Those people can get the same or better true help for themselves through private charity and help from their community.",1
9,I work in a place where i see people abusing the system it's frustrating that I'm here working 2 jobs to have all of this money being taken out of my paycheck and i can't even enjoy what i work for not only that when tax season comes around i STILL have to pay because i am a single person with no kids and i make to much money. I can't even afford a place to live.,1
9,"Welfare is horrible. there are too many people sitting on their asses playing video games and are in perfect shape for a job but they are just too lazy and the government (not to be rude) is too lazy/stupid to realize it. I don't want to work for lazy people. They are stealing our hard earned money from us hard workers. Even if you have a baby in your teens, you shouldn't get any free money, it was your fault for making a stupid mistake.",1
9,"When do we as a society say ""enough is enough"" I'm so F Ing tired of the STUPID assholes in Washington that really don't care about the people in this country...

They tell you what you want to hear just to shut you up!",1
9,"NOT PERMANENTLY MAKE THEM DEPENDENT ON OUR FREE MONEY ! You can dissect this any which way you prefer, but know this! The path we're on with all the free programs and the cost to sustain them will bankrupt this country long before any DAMN global warming ever will. My stepfather who put his life on the line for this country receives a pension from the military after all his years of service and his amount is less than 67 % of people on welfare ! This country has become almost a FAKE.. We pretend we're the Global leader but yet we can't even keep our own country financially stable !!! I'm so damn frustrated with this country and it seems that people really don't care... AND HOLD IT RIGHT there YOU PEOPLE GETTING READY TO TELL ME I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS COUNTRY AND TOO GET OUT IF I DON'T LIKE IT!!! Ido care about this country, in fact I pay well over $ 50K a year in personal taxes as well as a BUNCH more from my business. The American flag flies freely in my yard daily, I say we have a community welfare... it's like this everybody over the age of 18 is automatically given a monthly rate from the government $2500.00 or so but must have a job in order to receive it. The government funds will go to cover your everyday needs (food, shelter, clothing and transportation) if your working your also generating revenue to improve your life style along with helping the growth of the country, people will be spending money which will help increase GDP and put this country back on track again. I'm at the point where I've already bought 60 % of my wealth in gold and looking for another country that don't have straight out welfare programs ! I remember the old radio show that aired ""Earl Pitts"" he always said ""WAKE UP AMERICA"" WELL HERE YOU GO..... ""WAKE THE HELL UP AMERICA""",1
9,I was a single mom supporting 3 children.. Had some food stamps only maybe 6 mos. Never got anymore help. Medically or otherwise. It can be don't and should be don't. My children all work and don't live off welfare. Yet we have generations who know what answers to give. Stop the abuse,1
9,"I don't want to support welfare. I earn my money and it's for me and my family. If I decide to help someone out, then it's my choice to do so. I would rather that my tax continuation be diverted towards education. Make it an option. Those who feel the need to support others can do so. Those who don't wish to support others can no longer say that their money is being wasted. it's a win/win situation. If the funds run dry, then I guess the public has spoken.",1
9,"OK, let's think about that rationally, if you don't have money to support yourself alone what make you think it is good idea to have kids (in some cases 10+ kids). These people are clearly exploiting the welfare system and are getting away with it. I don't know which is worse the people that exploited the welfare system or our government enabling these people to do that.",1
9,"I don't mind the welfare to families in need for a short period of time. Or an old widow woman who has never worked because her husband did. The ones I hate to see are in line at the grocery store with 2 buggies full and pay $12 and the rest we pay for. These people are leeches on society. You should have to work 40 hours a week picking up trash or digging ditches, etc. for government assistance. If you make them work for it, less people would be on it.",1
9,"Take it away so we can all get every penny we work for because we all know that the government will lower our deductions as soon as it's gone ""insert eye roll"". there are more than enough jobs for EVERY able bodied American to make it without assistance (yeah that's sarcasm). Let's say for the sake of argument some of these ""lazy"" folks have to go to work and they take jobs from those that have them now, how would the other side feel now that they are hungry and can't find another job? (That's a true question) my biggest fear is the crime that WILL follow the folding of welfare... Humans are the most evil, mean and intelligent creature on earth, people will not simply lay down and starve to death when they can't make ends meet, they will survive, and survive any way they can, and if that's taking it from others, they will!, and it will be hard to protect what's ours 24/7.",1
9,"Most people work all their entire lives and live paycheck to paycheck with nothing left to save for retirement but they pay into social security. their is talk of cutting social security or getting rid of it altogether there are more people collecting Welfare from the government and they have never paid a dime to be eligible for collecting this free money and most are perfectly able to work. If the jobs that were sent overseas were brought back to the United States, there would be jobs available for these abled body individuals. Why should the elderly suffer, when others collect Welfare and never paid a dime to make them eligible for any aid. You cannot tell me that all these people are not able to find jobs or are not able to work. And I know of quite a few individuals who collected Welfare their entire lives and were perfectly able to work. This was before all the jobs went overseas. They just did not want to work and were given money not to work. Yes, poverty is real. Unfortunately our country has limited job opportunities to the American people due to mistakes they have made when they were young , or moving jobs to other countries for higher profits. Or requiring them to be bilingual when the language in our country is English. All of these situations have limited job availability to the American people. If a person has a bad driving record and are applying for a job that does not require driving, then it should not matter. That doesn't affect a person's responsibility but a person's credit history is what should be taken into consideration because that does show irresponsibility. These things need to change in order to make our country great again and to reduce the amount being paid out in Welfare. So yes, welfare should be cut and our elderly should be taken care of. The companies in the United States should stop being so greedy. When I hear of a company making less profits then the prior year but they still made significant profit, it makes me sick. Employees these days are overworked and stressed out because employers will not hire the correct amount of people to get the work don't due to wanting more profits. We should not give welfare to women just for having a baby either. If we want to help them, then maybe they should get help with daycare instead.",1
9,"Ok... Yes, i agree with people that need 2 get back on their feet, their are so many resources that help people do that, and welfare is one of them, but that is what it should be used for. Welfare should not be given to people who keep having children, and continue 2 get more money because of it. This is just baffling to me. I'm tired of hearing about people that say.. How are we suppose 2 eat. OMG! I mean, this is free money were just throwing at them. Why would they want to get a job. there's no reason. it's not going 2 change, so why even debate about it. I'll just get another job i guess. &;;#!@*",1
9,"80% of people on welfare abuse it. It should only be their for the mentally and physically disabled. All the inner city scumbags who have 4 kids and collect all this free money while baby daddy goes out and sells drugs, with a Mercedes sitting in the driveway. I personally know a lot of people who are doing just this. END THE FREE HANDOUTS NOW",1
9,"Unless an actual medical condition precludes someone from some from of work they should be taken off the welfare rolls, also state stores should be the only places food stamps could be used for purchases. That would limit the purchase of non essential items. I'm retired.. And I don't qualify for any aid. I don't know that I'd take it should I be qualified but then that's the entire difference isn't it?",1
9,"I would be in support of SOME welfare with a LIMITED timeframe in which someone can collect DESERVED benefits, but the current system as it is must be changed. Too many people who haven't worked a day in their life are sitting at home all day while the rest of us are working to pay their way. Then the fact that they can have more kids and collect more? That's absurd! Why are we paying people to sit at home having sex all day to pop out more kids so they can get a ""raise""?",1
9,"I watch people eat and live better than myself, and I'm making about 44K a year as a single person. Why am I paying high taxes and watching this occur right before my eyes? Why did I opt not to have kids because I couldn't afford them, yet others on welfare have multiple and get tax breaks. This does nothing but help the WRONG people reproduce! Stop giving and start taking back! Support the people that actually want to work instead of the people who continue to freeload and ride the system! - Iowa",1
9,Back in the in early 1900's they did not have welfare. They should bring back to when they said '' if you don't work you don't eat /john smith''. The united states would also save so much money by getting rid of welfare money. People are also too lazy to go and find jobs.,1
9,I'm tired of paying everyone's insurance and buying their groceries will they brag about a free ride and free college tuition. I work every day and certainly can't afford to go to college and why should hard working people have to pay for the lazy people. I have rheumatoid arthritis and still HAVE to work because to many single moms have five kids and no husband with a job. Not my fault Or drug addicts crying saying they can't work. Not my fault either. No one comes to help me when I can't walk down my steps or doubled over in pain. Where's my free ride. To many people with nothing wrong with them abusing something meant for the people who can't get it. Color or history has nothing to do with being a responsible adult today. Let's all be more productive not a leech to society.,1
9,"My point is, we work hard for the money we earn. We should get to keep it! People who won't work, let me tell you this. I am in 6th grade and I know that this is wrong. The welfare system is for people who CAN'T work. Not for people who won't. Welfare wouldn't be such a bad thing if people would stop abusing it. Some people have good intentions, and I respect that, but what will happen in the future? Will you go on like this forever? Is that really what you want?",1
9,Welfare people are just sitting back and collecting checks while other people are working their asses off to support welfare people.,1
9,"What this comes down to is putting a stop to the abuse of the system. This is becoming a generation thing. People grow up using this assistance so they feel like they're entitled to it. it's a learned behavior and without proper departments to handle the case loads of applications or monitor the families or individuals applying or using assistance, it needs to stop. Cut the head of the snake. there are plenty of that use these programs because they can get away with it. No one told you to go have children out of wedlock or have more kids then you can afford to take care of. Your child is your problem, i didnt help you to create it so i don't need to take care of it with my tax money. I grew up as a poor kid in an urban environment but my family never took advantage of any assistance programs. As an adult i enrolled in school and found a career. I put my career and future first before creating a life i can't sustain without help because of how i grew up. When things are offered, things will be taken. Stop offering tax money to take care of people that won't take care of themselves.",1
9,"In 1995 the government spent 332.5 billion dollars in welfare alone, and sure that was some years ago that's still a hell of a lot of money. Money that comes out of my check to pay greedy fat druggies who don't work at all which is ridiculous let the money stay to those who actually go out everyday and work for their check",1
9,The people don't know any sense of what work is and they will be rewarded for the rest of their life for doing what... Absolutely nothing but getting checks from the US. government and using other American's hard earned money. Instead they could go out and get a job and actually know a sense of working and that hard work paying off.,1
9,there is no help for people that do the right thing have no kids and no debt why can I get help if my car breaks down or I get sick no more child support either you did it you be responsible for it it's so hard for me I went to school and still catch my ass paying bills to be successful am over it,1
9,"Look I understand people need help, but the reason they don't help themselves is because government is their to step in and help them, via the taxpayer. Have you ever had a kid look you in the eye and say I'm hungry -daddy or mommy. And your response to that innocent child is what? If you had that actually happen to you do you think your response would be, sorry baby, the government doesn't have any food for us. Or do you think you get up, use the gifts God blessed you with and feed that child? I promise you would never hear that child say ""im hungry"" again.",1
9,"it's created more people in poverty, more people dependent on the government. The working taxpayers can't keep up with the cost of providing for other people's choices. It is literally wiping out the middle class trying to pay for other people's benefits. Those people need to suck it up and live in situations that they don't love (instead of having their housing paid for by us). Live with your parents, your aunt, your cousin, your friend, or another single mother. Take turns watching each other's children while you WORK. Too bad you don't have a smartphone. I don't care. You eating Oodles of Noodles every night? I don't care. (I did at one time!) They were all your CHOICES! Maybe people will think twice before having yet another child if THEY have to work to support it.",1
9,The government is taking the people's ability to decide away. They are forcing everyone to give money to charity. They are taking the right of the people to choose what they do with their hard earned money away and giving it to the leeches that don't want to work. there is no motivation for these lazy people to work and get ahead. We don't owe anyone anything. If you don't work for something you don't deserve it.,1
9,"The more we work, the more the government gives them. My poor mother makes less working like an animal then people that recently came and were smart enough to fake they had mental problems. I HATE IT SO MUCH!!!!!!! Words cannot express my frustration. My fridge is half way empty and they have 700$ in food stamps. Who can possibly agree with this? END IT!!!",1
9,"Yes, the economy sucks and sad that people are starving. But why have a care load full of kids if you can't support them when the going gets tough? I notice the more poor people are the more children they have. Maybe if people stop having 5 or more kids they could get ahead in life. Why should people have to bust their bottoms for other people's children? If people need more jobs then we need to fight for America! The United States government promotes people and illegal to get on welfare. I say stop the free ride for everyone! Allegedly in an article a household was on welfare in a million dollar house! Sell the house if you cannot afford to live! there are many scams on welfare. Yes a few people actually need welfare, but the users ruined everything! And the people I know on welfare are uneducated and refuse to move on. Also those people drink and smoke on government dime! If you can't pay for yourself, why have 4 + children knowing any day situations can change? it's the parents fault in their children starve! Maybe they can teach others to have less children they can actually take care of!",1
9,"This outdated Amendment was very necessary to provide legal status to people brought into America against their will as slaves. It is now just a loophole used by criminals who enter illegally for the purpose of birthing anchors and sucking the welfare system dry. Continuing to provide legal status to anchors, free birthing at our hospitals and a free ride thru welfare is just plain ignorant. Monthly, random date drug testing for anyone on welfare would help weed out the druggies abusing the ""system""",1
9,I realize there are people who are unable to work but too many are living off tax dollars without even trying to get a job. If we don't eliminate welfare altogether then we at least need more policing. Maybe we need random drug tests. If you fail then you don't qualify. I think we should stop giving free handouts. This is the land of opportunity and jobs are available if people are willing to work. Burger flipping isn't beneath anyone. Also live within your means. You want a better job then you should stay in school.,1
9,"I don't hate EVERYONE on welfare! I have worked in schools for 23 years and the abuse is mind boggling! Public schools actually HELP these generational losers get more of my tax dollars, then charge property owners more tax to ""help"" the children of these Families to the tune of $50,000 and up per ""special needs"" student to ""teach"" these future drop outs. What a total waste! The average student doesn't stand a chance. Money not well spent! Who cares about them? The special needs kids will more then likely never contribute to society, yet we spend 3 and 4 times more on them, then the school turns around and cuts programs that could benefit average students who will be in their turn paying for their special needs classmates in the future. Doesn't make sense to me.",1
9,"I support the need for unemployment help for a short period since trouble happens for people when they least expect it. People lose jobs for reasons they can't help and it's not always easy to get the next one right away. So a month of help is okay. Welfare is completely different. It allows for the lazy to stay lazy and not work to better themselves. Everyone has money troubles, it's not our responsibility to help everyone. I'm struggling financially to pay off student loans, but I'm working to pay them off. I don't ask for people to pay them off for me. End welfare.",1
9,"Everytime someone gets ""hurt"" or thinks they are too sick to work they file for SSDI. This is so wrong in so many ways. We need to teach US citizens to work thru the pain and that is not an acceptable behavior to ask the government to pay them to stay at home or work for cash.... Yes times are hard and yes there are jobs out their, if the government want to help the poverty, then give assistance to people that have low income jobs. We don't need to give assistance to the ones that have children just so they can receive more assistance from the government. taxpayers should get a HUGE tax break if they are working, and only have 2 or less children, not when they have 2 or more children and not working.",1
9,We love helping the poor. So to call us hateful to want to get rid of welfare is absurd. Taking from hard workers and giving it to the poor should be the decision of the earner. Also their is such thing as MOTIVE so when people who are sitting at home collecting their checks from the government have absolutely NO motive. Obama is using welfare to buy votes and that is not okay.,1
9,I feel welfare should be for veterans or people making contribution or striving to achieve and may need help along the way. Too many people sitting on their butt using welfare as a way of life. To make it simple assistance should only be give if you are working less than 20 hours a week or you are in school,1

But you would not BELIEVE how often I had overweight women toting iPhones (!!!) yelling at me because they didn't like the shampoo brand. This was a regular occurrence. I have NO problem with supporting those who really need and/or have earned it--the mentally disabled, veterans, physically disabled, orphans and foster kids--but most of the people who use food stamps DON'T NEED THEM",1
9,"I work in an atmosphere where we take Medicaid and Medicaid based insurances. All day long, I see patient after patient walk in with their state assistance insurance. Because of medical history, questions, and observation, I know that the system is being abused by 90% of my patients. Of course there are plenty who deserve welfare: those living with what most people call ""handicaps"" such as Down syndrome. I would gladly give these awesome people cash from my paycheck. But when a mother of five and expecting another comes walking in 20 minutes late for three appointments with no apologies or cares, that's when it hits home. their are so many problems with this system, I can not imagine where one would start to decrease the abuse!",1
9,From experience of the people I know on welfare don't need it. Their drive better cars then I a hard working middle class citizen does! Their children wear expensive $200 and $300 dollar shoes they sew into their heads $400 hair! HOW can you afford this on welfare?!? These people don't need it ! Although I must say I'm blessed when I see that FICA on my check if left up to me I say let them starve! Let them go uninsured! These people could have gone and gotten their higher education easily! Always hooping and hollering they can't pay for college! They get too many damn breaks! My parents slaved and paid every cent of my college education besides the small loan I took out for books each semester! Stop giving these lowly people a hand. I know I sound like a complete ass but in truth stop this welfare a lot of these people don't need it. Access the true need for those who truly do!,1
9,"I have had to work 3 jobs and miss sleep to do it but hey isn't that what grown men/women are supposed to do? The welfare system in the it's essence was a good idea, help people who can't help themselves, however aside from injury (physical or mental) or during recessions the majority of people using welfare are abusing it. I was taught growing up that you could have anything you wanted by working hard well apparently I'm order to get what you want you just have to drive 20 minutes (in your tax-paid for care) to your local welfare line. It sickens me and is in direct violation of the oldest rule...Survival of the fittest. Take the welfare away and people will either work or die.",1
9,it's gotten to the point where people who work incredibly hard to earn their money end up giving it away to others who often times don't even attempt to earn a job. In over 1/3 of the states in the US a welfare check pays better than minimum wage jobs if one were to work an average amount of hours. If welfare is to continue then the people who are receiving it should be given jobs by the government to earn their money like the rest of the population.,1
9,"The stark reality is that the federal government is broke. It borrows money every year to cover the deficit. Obviously, that can't go on forever. Eventually, welfare will end. It may be when the government can no longer borrow. It may be sooner, if our elected officials start to pay attention to the federal debt. Welfare WILL end. (So will a number of federal programs that benefit the rich.). The longer it lasts, the more painful the end will be.",1
9,Listen the welfare systems is corrupt and their are people who use it correctly who have it for a year get back on their feet and get off it but far more use it wrong. Now the worse welfare is when are government gives businesses money this is way more expensive than giving people welfare. If a business can't get their product to sell and the go in to bankruptcy to bad the economy needs companies that will do it for themselves. If you gave every company money the free market competitiveness would be gone.,1

People can use the typical excuse that children would go hungry if there was no welfare but the moment the government hits the state of collapse because our money won't mean anything, what then? I lived in poverty without assistance growing up and I got out of it without any wonderful education or help. People from these excuses that they must have it because they're comfortable with others taking care of them. You guys can argue with me and know that I'm right but you'll all be truly screwed once a government collapse happens then you'll know what true poverty is. On top of living in true poverty, you'll have to survive the tens of millions of lawless people. The true unemployment rate right now in America is right around 25%.

Over the past 2 years, I've racked up debt to pay the rent, buy groceries and put gas in my care. Before that, all I mostly had was student loans. I pay a lot of taxes into the system, and now I'm working two jobs and I live paycheck to paycheck. I'm a law-abiding, hard-working citizen. Why do people who do nothing all day except watch tv, fight, curse, do drugs and engage in laziness get to eat while I starve? Also, I recently experienced a major illness, but due to doctor error and the laziness of my former job's HR staff, I only got one check from my disability insurance company and that check was of course not enough to cover the rent. I found another job, but I'm still trying to recover. It makes me feel so disgusted that ingrates are getting benefits thanks to my hard work. Some of those ingrates who live in my neighborhood are the same ones disrupting my sleep with the loud rap music from their cars--their nice, new-looking cars that look way better then my poor-looking care. Also, these are the same ones dealing drugs, smoking, getting hairdos and mani-pedis, and their children have cell phones that are nicer than my basic phone. It seems that the more I try to do the right and upstanding thing, the poorer I get. Why does the government continue to reward the lazy while punishing me for working and not having a child? Excuse me for making smart choices instead of allowing myself to become another statistic. I always thought that if I work hard and make smart choices that I would at least be able to live debt-free and have access to basic needs like nutritious food, healthcare and a peaceful environment. I just don't have it in me to do what other women who share my skin tone have don't by having a bunch of kids and collecting a check and food stamps.",1
9,"I can't believe how easy it is to get welfare. I think it should be a more screened process rather than here you're poor have free money. I know many bright and intelligent ""poor"" people who are just lazy. Probably only 1/9 need it for real but the others need to be looking for work and or try to. It drains our economy and our country won't prosper because the poor but it will on the middle class who is drained daily for lazy hankies who have been milking the feds for their whole lives.",1
9,"I'm sick of the fact that I have to support people who are unwilling to support themselves. I believe most of the people on welfare are their by choice rather then by circumstance, welfare is suppose to help them get ahead in life by providing food and housing while they pursue a better life for themselves by either finding a job, going to school or learning a skill in order be off of welfare, but the problem is that there IS NO INITIATIVE from them to better themselves. The absence of initiative is what keeps them on welfare. They have a sense of entitlement that they believe they deserve things from which they never had to achieve and it is because if this mindset that they CHOOSE to stay on welfare because they believe they deserve everything without giving anything back in return.",1
9,"I realize the benefits of welfare. And YES there are some people who truly need welfare to make ends meet. And YES there are some people who are hardworking and will use the welfare programs to get work and wean off the welfare programs. These programs simply need to be reformed to stop people from abusing them. I am more then willing to help those less fortunate than I am, but I am not willing to help someone live off welfare with no intention of ever getting off it. Looking at our federal budget, 33% of the budget is spent on welfare and pensions; the biggest expense we have. And we are in NATIONAL DEBT. Yes, I would love to be in a nation that can baby every citizen, but we are not in a position to be throwing money around. The government should focus on fixing internal problems first. This is why we need to reform welfare programs to ensure that our valuable money is going to someone deserving and truly in need.",1
9,"When has the federal government ever don't a better job at something then the private sector? Never! Cut federal welfare 25% a year for four years until it's gone and encourage private welfare systems such as churches and charities to assist the poor. If someone needs help but is too prideful to go to them for help, so be it. They can face the consequences of their own choice and remain in poverty.",1
9,"I don't know or care about you, so money should not come from me to support you. People are so concerned with helping everyone, but guess what, they wouldn't help you. The majority of people on welfare are dirt bags that would rather spend money on clothes, cars and drugs then take responsibility for their own Damon family and work. Unless you physically can not work, you deserve nothing.",1
9,"I see a lot of the people saying no here are bringing up arguments about disabled and people who cannot work. In those cases, fine. But disability should be a stipulation (not laziness and playing the system). To those who say it's for the kids, what about the HUGE growing population of people who treat their child as a paycheck and don't actually care for them at all? Keep the child care assistance programs to help people work who can't afford child care (while also providing jobs for people at these child care facilities), but don't just keep handing out freebies to people perfectly capable of working. People who would otherwise not have kids or give them up for adoption keep them so they can get their welfare- people intentionally have more kids to get more welfare! If the taxpayers pay for these kids food, shelter, recreation, health, schooling, etc. what is the driving factor to push people to get a job? Why can't welfare consist of food and homeless shelters? Why should people on welfare get cell phones and money to support leisure activities? These are not necessities. The welfare is quickly spiraling out of control. The programs are abused and what was created to help children and families is now hurting them. Ask anyone, and I'm sure they will tell you they know more people who abuse the system then those who actually use it to get back on their feet. Want to create more jobs for the poor people who can't find one? Create some positions to regulate welfare or wish our future generations luck.",1
9,"Some of these people who live off welfare are half single mothers who go with these deadbeat guys that don't take care of their child. But even though their guys are dead beats. It is still some of these single mothers fault they put themselves in a situation like that. So they feel they don't have to go to school or get a job to take care of their children because they can live off the government. But i will give respect to those single mothers who work their ass off and goes to school to take care of their kids and don't need the government's help. Same with some dudes that want to live off the government to take care them. But that just brings shame to that man hood, because a real man works an takes care of what is his. So this is one of my reasons why welfare should be cut off period",1
9,I am 20 years old working two jobs and a student in college. When I hear the word Welfare I get so angry. Walking into the store to by food for the week and having a mother with her 5 kids running around causing a scene in the checkout line drives me nuts. Clearly having just got fake nails don't and hair don't yet pulling out an EBT card to pay for the full cart of junk food while I have about 26 items in my cart containing veggies and meats isn't really fair in my book. Why should I work from 7am till 11 pm while you sit at home or go shopping? I don't make enough for myself because the Government thinks that you should have money to go and blow on pointless things instead of for myself when all I do is work. Maybe it is a good thing sense I can't enjoy it due to working all the time to support your family.. I think personally if you don't work you don't get anything.,1
9,"Welfare was not set up as a means to support babies born out of wedlock, give free medical care, support generational welfare, or pay college/school tuition. I developed a chronic life-threatening disease when I was 15 years old. I work hard just so I can stay alive. I don't receive government assistance, free medical care, or school tuition. I work full time and still cannot stay afloat. Medical care and medications eat up my income and more. I wish the government would work harder to help people that are in situations due to no fault of their own. I have legally worked and paid taxes for 34 years of my life, and when I recently lost my job, my unemployment ran out after 6 months. How do people do it (and feel) when they receive unemployment for up to two years and have barely worked at all??? I will never know what it is like to be debt free as in any given year, the least that I owe is $3000 in medical debts alone. Make government assistance what it should be...Assistance, not a way of life!",1
9,I don't have a college education.Been married for 36 yrs with same woman and 2-sons. We both have worked full time. I have only had to draw unemployment 3 times for a total of 6 months. For the last 4yrs the couple across the street from us have had 2 kids out of wedlock not counting the 2 she already . The father of the kids is police officer. She said they don't want to get married because they will lose all government help.They have been shacked up for 10yrs. In their eyes they are doing no wrong because everyone else is doing the same thing.,1
9,My wife and I make less than $40000 a year but don't get or need assistance. We use our money to pay our bills and get what we need. Crazy right. Welfare is ok for the elderly or for short term use. If you're on welfare for more than 6 months you are a leech and a lazy one that can't even suck for your self. The government doesn't have to get rid of the program but it should be a lot of harder to get and their should be a period of time before you're able to get help again,1
9,"Just because their are people with no education does not mean give them free handouts. it's coming out of not only my paycheck, but everyone else's. All of america is supporting the lower class by working and actually making money to support ourselves. This severely hurts the incentive people come to america for everyday. Why would I want to work many hours of labor just to have my time and money taken away? I might as well also just live on welfare also. In today's world, their are so many opportunities to get the proper education in order to succeed and support yourself. there is no excuse for being ""undereducated."" As far as hungry children, raise money instead of taking from the incentive of our country-it's working class. I agree with using welfare short term, but long term, it's hurting america. it's not helping anyone get out of poverty unless they use it for educational purposes.",1
9,"Some people really do need it. I understand. But I see one person that is for it getting their masters degree while collecting? Sorry, you get to better yourself while on welfare? Too many people rob the system. You want government money to not work, you better be disabled. Otherwise, mandate community service as part of the process. Don't just send a check to some scumbag that sits at home playing xbox all day claiming to need welfare.",1
9,"As I know too well. Many people out their believe that welfare is needed. I agree, yes welfare is needed for the people who TRULY cannot work; but 75% of people on welfare are abusing the system and can work just fine. Instead of getting jobs these individuals sit back on their comfy (government paid for couches) and play their xbox systems on their big screens while smoking a stogie and drinking a beer and monitoring their Iphone 5's. As far as I'm concerned these people are common criminals and stealing taxpayer money and they should be forced to PAY IT BACK!!! If these individuals can't get what they want from welfare they know how to turn welfare into cash money simply by buying someone else's groceries in return for half the cash. Then they take that cash and buy whatever they want to. The government seriously needs to reconsider the evaluation of welfare and make it harder to obtain for system abusers (like it's hard to do that!!!) I mean come on. Get off your ass and work please!!!",1
9,"there's a difference between entitlements and handouts. Just because you are an American does not mean you are entitled to anything. If you put money into the system then you are entitled to that money. But because you got fired or arrested or whatever and ""can't"" find work because of it, does not mean you are entitled to anything. You messed up, you deal with the consequences. However if you are born with something that prevents you from working any job anywhere, then I would willing give you some of my money. Welfare is pretty much forced charity, which is legalized stealing. Many people who qualify for welfare, little people, deaf, mentally disabled, and more, refuse the handout and find work. I applaud those people. their needs to be more of them.",1
9,"More people willing to work ,and more people are willing to fight for their life. Government should end welfare because giving money to poor is not right way to help them. A lot middle class have to suffer without help from government. And ""poor"" actually have whole package health care, cash, food stamp, house support, free water free gas even transportation so why work? It only keep people away from work (unless they feel shame ) and increase the living expense. If government don't pay for their house those ""poor"" won't have money to move out so they have to stay with their parent or family. House for rent then the middle class don't have pay high rent. Without food stamp ""poor"" won't buy lobster, Steak and many expensive food then these food will cheaper than middle class don't have to pay for high price food. If no healthcare the ""poor' won't go to doctor every ""week"" then we won't ran out doctor, so middle class won't have to pay for expensive healthcare insurance. Anyway giving money to poor is killing economic and middle class hard worker",1
9,I seen what would jesus do?? Really?? I guarantee he would not give handouts because men/women can't keep it in their pants.. Ohh I'm sure they are all married right?? Government assistance should be just that assistance not a JOB/LIVING.. Nor would jesus condone laziness.. Seen a video the other day of a woman in Georgia with 7 kids.. 7 kids?? Sitting in a welfare line for like 8 hrs because she was shorted on her free stuff.. Go to work for 8 hrs.. No babysitter?? A grandparent can watch them.. Nobody wants to be responsible for the things they do in their lives anymore it's sickening.. People are flakes and losers.. If you can't feed em don't breed em.. Ps: I'm not religious.. I just have a brain in my head and can use it.. I used to get pissed when I seen people at the store with 3 buggies fulllllll of food.. But then I realized I come home to a wonderful wife that WORKS.. I have a nice house and a piece of land in the country and plenty of toys bet you can't get that with a wic card.. My dad had me at 17 finished high school and worked 2 jobs while my mom stayed at home because I was sick.. And guess what he is a MAN.. A provider.. Guess what welfare rats your kids don't respect you!!,1
9,"More and more people are relying on welfare, not because they are incapable or hit rock bottom; it's because they are taking the easy way out. Majority of the younger people get knocked up hoping that they can apply for wic and food stamps. This is what we are teaching the younger generations: Get knocked up so that you don't have to work. I am tired of working myself to death to make ends meet. I chose NOT to have kids at the moment because I know that I am not financially stable to raise MY KID on my own. Yes, i agree that children should not have to suffer; however, half the time the money does not go to the children but to the lazy parent(s) who chose to put themselves in this situation! They use their children as a meal ticket!! Monthly check ins and drug test should be a requirement!! Why is it the employers require drug test for those who actually wants to earn a living; while half the people on welfare uses our hard earn money to buy drugs. I see so many people use our hard earn money to buy drugs and materialistic things instead of saving for the child's future. We are enabling people to become lazy. They are hustling the system and profiting from those who work their asses off. I think that if you are capable enough to have kids then you are capable enough to find a job!! Limit the time a person can received aid and actually force them to find a job!!!! STOP ENABLING LAZINESS",1
9,"I am a bank employee who has seen first hand for years how many of these recipients come in with checks bigger than my monthly salary. Many of them can barely sign the check because their hands are shaking from drug use. I have seen able bodied women live off the system their entire life, including one who encouraged her son not to work so she could get more assistance and now he is in his twenties with no job experience. He will likely apply for assistance soon, further perpetuating the cycle. I wouldn't mind paying out of my taxes if the money went to those truly in need, someone physically incapable for example. Or a working mother doing everything she can but not making enough to put food on the table. But the system actually PUNISHES the WORKING mothers because the ones who DON'T WORK get the most funding. It is a ridiculous, flawed system and no one can tell me that it encourages people to better themselves. It encourages people to feel entitled to assistance and to live off others hard work.",1
9,Obviously their parents don't beyond using them for their own personal financial support so why should the rest of us? In this modern age of birth control there are no excuses for the continued motherhood as a career situations. Further generally the offspring of these welfare mothers become welfare parents themselves. Eliminate it,1
9,"Welfare is a broken system that while the idea of it is sound the actual system is not working. Welfare needs to be limited so people can't get it for more than 2 years, which would hopefully stop those who abuse it but still help those who simply are out of luck or made one bad decision when they were younger that ruined them.",1
9,"In a perfect world welfare is great but this isn't a perfect world. People are dependent on the government and that's not a good thing. I've paid into social security for 37 years and when I reach retirement I expect to draw out of the system. their is nothing wrong with that. I am sick of paying for other families groceries when i am trying to figure out how to have gas money to get to work. My daughter worked in a grocery store and she said that their are people with $900+ a month from just food stamps. Something has to change if we could afford welfare it would be great but people abuse it so end it. If I open up my house to you, why would you steal from me?",1
9,"As a child who grew up on welfare, I have some idea of what I am talking about. My single mother lost her job when I was in first grade, and all of my elementary school years consisted of her being to lazy to find a job. Welfare left her the choice to not work at the expense of everyone else, and she was happy that way. Our neighbors would often have her buy them groceries and pay her back with drugs. I lived in section 8 (poor people) housing and everyone of our neighbors could have worked, they just didn't want to. Now as an adult with a steady job, and most of my student loans paid for, I am not grateful that I had Welfare. It just gave my family a reason to be lazy. And for that ""what would Jesus do?"" debate, He would have us INDIVIDUALS and the CHURCH care for people instead of letting the government get involved. Saw this on a bumper sticker ""I am a conservative because not EVERYONE can be on welfare.""",1
9,"Charity breeds laziness. No one who isn't physically or mentally disabled should be allowed to refuse to work and collect money. I agree that there is a need for the snap, wic, and section 8 programs, however there should be no cash assistance and anyone caught selling goods bought with snap or wic should lose those benefits. If someone needs more assistance then free food, shelter, and power their should be a program in place to let them perform simple labor for a fair wage. I grew up in a family where both my parents worked 2 jobs to make ends meet. If you give someone cash to spend for sitting on their butt, what incentive do they have to look for work? A good incentive to look for a better job is digging ditches and cleaning up graffiti/litter 8 hours a day 5 days a week in exchange for assistance.",1
9,"I once saw a kid at a gas station step out of a shiny new car with temporary tags and walk inside and grab all junk food and energy drinks and go to pay with food stamps. The kid was decked out in all new designer clothing as well. I asked him how it felt to get everything for free and not have to pay for the essentials so he could blow his money on clothes, a care, and his shiny new iphone and he replies ""Man shut the hell up you just a racist hating on a black man"". End it now!!! I don't work my ass off for people to abuse the system and then call me a racist for calling them out on it!!!",1
9,"Where is their AMERICAN pride? If they are not AMERICAN and cannot speak the English language, they should not be given a HANDOUT. Would their country support us? Bring the taxes down for American business and start building in America. I will NEVER buy ""Made in China"". I will go without it!",1
9,I personally don't think it's fair that I can work hard for my money and some of my check goes to someone sitting on their couch in their house. It is not that hard to find a minimum wage job and get some money and food on the table but people are lazy and would rather have the government pay for them. If welfare ended people would have more motivation to get their own jobs and start providing for themselves.,1
9,"Do I need to say more? Welfare should only be for either the disabled, or the elderly. OR if it is needed for the children , then give these lazy parents strictly VOUCHERS for THEIR CHILD ONLY. Food vouchers, clothing vouchers, and MAYBE pay the families rent. Period. I would also not give them anymore money if they decide to have more children. I work at Service Ontario ( welfare office in Canada) and a lot of people on welfare purposely have more children to get the extra $400 per month. it's sickening. They always have designer brand clothes, fancy nails, and an iphone in their hand all while their children look like salvation army cases. SO sad.",1

9,"Welfare should either stop, cut benefits, or decrease amount of time of persons on welfare. The program has too many loopholes.

Always skittles, chips, ice cream and debby cakes. I'm not on Food Stamps and i can't afford extra snacks so why should they get to spend 50$ a week on them? WITH TAX DOLLARS. They're ungrateful, lazy, impolite scum. Who don't deserve the luxury of free food. If Food Stamps can not be taken away do to the very few families out their who do not abuse it, then candy and sweets should NOT be included. If you have enough cash to get your hair and nail don't every week you can buy your own damn candy.",1
9,"YES!!! The government should end welfare!!! This country was NOT built on HANDOUTS!!! It was built on EVERYONE PULLING TOGETHER!!! And NO!!!

Our founding forefathers must be rolling over in their graves if they can see what is happening to our beautiful country. The ""losers"" are taking over and it has to STOP.....NOW!!!

Liberals have no problem with me working do my death to make money and taking their cut before I even get mine, then buying votes. And paying people not to work. Should we end entitlement yes, because it forces people to work. If you want to donate or help others like humans do that's your choice and mine. The sweat of my labor should not before your to exploit and for people to vote on how they can use my struggle to their advantage.

These people are motivated and have become leaders based on their experience . it's just saddening that those who abuse it have caused such a havoc to create such a horrible opinion towards them. Perfect t example is myself , I use to be sympathetic to those on welfare but after seeing so many families , especially women and their children overweight buying junk food food ,paying with welfare for that and then buying alcohol with their own money on a second transaction. it's disgusting !!!!!!!. How far can we go verbally and mentally thinking about this without doing anything. We must do something !! They're are lawyers fighting for women's equality but honestly I think I this is way more serious then that. We need. To stand up and fight for our hard worked money . We can do it in a well mannerly way with ethical cutbacks and education awareness . We must start somewhere! This country deserves better !!!!!. Our grandfathers for father's did not fight to have lazy people abuse us ,produce disrespectful children,and are not patriotic .",1
9,"I would support the welfare system more, if it were equally distributed to EVERYONE in need; Not just women with poor planning and decision-making skills or low/no motivation. But it is impossible for a single poor woman or a single poor man to get assistance. The welfare system is outdated, and geared towards rewarding people for reproducing. The world is overpopulated, humanity is not on the verge of extinction (Thanks to breakthroughs in modern medicine), we don't need to keep rewarding people for popping out 3 -7 kids at a time, ESPECIALLY when they couldn't afford the 1st one they had. WHY aren't we rewarding people who make RESPONSIBLE decisions, like waiting until they are financially stable enough to afford a child? Finishing post-secondary education and securing unemployment BEFORE popping out a kid? Single people without children struggle too, and their lives are just as important as any ""oops"" baby. If single childless men and women got the same type of support that ""Families"" (Read: Single mother, multiple child households) received, we would have more stable society, and more stable families contributing to society. We need some SERIOUS welfare reform.",1
9,I know loads of people that don't work and live off welfare for people to get welfare they should have drug tests and at least have a job to get. Isn't people that live off welfare earning around 20 a hour when people working earn less? Example a guy had a fine on his bathroom because it was bad and then got paid 10 grand to live somewhere else so they could fix it and he wasn't even working,1
9,"I think the government should stop welfare and people need to go out and get a job. Stop sitting at home being fat and lazy and quit relying on the people who actually work. The government is so quick to go after our military pay when they are having budget issues when they have other means of saving money. I understand their people with disabilities and are unable to work but I also know that a big percentage of the people on welfare are on it because they are just too lazy to get up and go to work. It doesn't help our country's leader lets anyone and everyone who wants to enter this country get in for free and then they go right to the welfare line. I can't tell you how many people I see on welfare and driving these high end priced car around. It makes me sick to see what this country has turned into. their are veterans out their who have sacrificed so much for this country only to go looking for a job and get turned away. I have also heard of certain people being told that they are the wrong skin color when they try to get welfare. Another thing, if you apply for welfare, you should be required to submit a drug test. If you apply for a job and need a drug test for that, you should need to pass a drug test for welfare.",1
9,"We America should should have a march to protest against Welfare!! My mother worked two jobs her whole life here to support the family and never once ask for government help, Welfare is just a political strategy to get control of the lazy minorities.

9,Warfare should have been only for the citizen who are retired that can not live just from pensions and to the veterans who needs help. To all immigrants that wants to bring their family in the US should be responsible for them not the Government.

I tired of seeing people using lame excuses for not working, and I'm tired of people sitting on their ass and making more money then I make. I know a lady who makes 600 on welfare, 300 on food stamps, 500 HUD house payment made for her, 200 electric bill played and has 2 people that live with her and pay 250 each to live with her",1
9,I personally know several young couples who abuse the system and they tell people about it and encourage others to try it. it's so sad that people so young in their early twenties have learned how to abuse the system by seeing their parents do it for years. A girl I knew had so much money being given to her that she had so much food in her house it literally looked like a mini mart. Things started to expire so she started stocking can foods and going to local grocery stores and buying hundreds of dollars of food till she reached the max each month. It was literally like a game to her. She needed to spend every penny of her free money even if she didn't need it. And here I am living off sandwiches because I can't afford better food. She's encouraged me to get on the program but I refuse to sink that low and live off stolen money. Americans work hard for that money and it's not fair to take from the working to give to the non working. One day I'll find a better job so I can buy better food for myself but for now I'll eat my sandwiches.,1
9,It not fair us hard working people pay taxes to lazy hand out good for nothing welfare that don't want to hard i hope they starve himself obama is responsible. We should not pay taxes to those lazy welfare people who can work but rather get handout they are no good they don't deserve anything good.,1
9,"I live in the state of Maine, their is poverty up here, poverty that you don't see in the south, or in the cities even, their are people up here without power, people up here without indoor plumbing, and worse of all, people without heating. Now one would think the first thing to do would be to provide welfare for these people, but you would be wrong, as they already have it. Welfare abuse up here is rampant, these people would trade their stamps for a lesser quantity of cash to a local broker, and then spend it on cigs, or the new Bath Salts up around Bangor. It has to stop, those that abide the law and pay their due can't afford this much longer.... It Has to Stop, For the Good of All of Us.",1
9,"Give a dog a bone and he won't want to hunt anymore. Welfare is used to gain votes for the Democratic party. The DP is selling this great nation down the drain.... Want to help people? Have free schools (we do, and they don't study) have libraries and museums... (we do and they don't go)",1
9,I work very hard 60 hours a week to support my family. I'm tired of my hard earned money going to feed the lazy and ignorant. I say if ya don't work don't eat. It infuriates me to see at the end of the year I owe the government money but a single mom with 10 kids gets a big fat check. Where is the justice?? I am not sympathetic with the low life's and am quite sick of supporting them and their families. Everyone faces hard times but a hand out does not help anyone it only cripples you and makes you weak. Learn to dig yourself out of the hole you got yourself into. Let the lazy starve,1
9,"Some people are born rich and some poor, some even in between; but that's still no excuse. If someone wants to make it in life they have to do whatever is required. The only people I would understand are people that were a part of the military but they should only get help for a limit a couple of years and a family that lost the breadwinner in a tragedy so the government should provide some help but also knowledge to parent to make up for their loss and become themselves the breadwinner",1
9,"Welfare was designed as a ""helping hand"" during hard times, NOT, generations after generations of support. Welfare recipients who can work should be forced to sweep streets, pick up trash, clean government buildings in order to receive assistance. Getting something for NOTHING is just plain wrong. Abuse of welfare has to stop!!!!!",1
9,"Why should other people take my hard earned money just because they are too lazy to get a job. their are so many jobs available it's not even funny. Mcdonalds, Marshalls, radio shack and other places always help wanted signs where I live. Welfare is ridiculous, people in MA who are on welfare receive more than people with minimum wage jobs. I see these bums buying smokes and liquor everyday. ""Give a man a fish and he eats for a day"". Instead of doing that we give people on welfare a free cell phone, good housing and all the beer and tobacco they want. We have given them way to much of our hard earned money. it's time we stop the madness.",1
9,"If you don't work, you don't eat. it's as simple as that. Medicare is being used and abused and laziness is rampant. their are always extenuating circumstances but they are in the minority.

9,"Before I say this, I'd like to point out that in real life, I have a very severe case of Sickle Cell Anemia. But I manage to support myself mainly because I started out with a good family that supported me. Here's what I'd do if that wasn't the case: If I was unable to support myself, I would go to a charity or homeless shelter, not collect welfare. If there weren't any of those, I DEFINITELY wouldn't have kids, I would accept that I cannot support myself. I would do all I could to support myself, and if I couldn't and I ended up dying because of my condition, I would. I wouldn't mooch off of others. People who do mooch off of others are worthless scum that should be killed and removed from the gene pool. If anyone on welfare thinks that I should die because of saying something ""so horrible,"" then don't worry; I will. I will die by the time I am in my late 30s to mid 40s. At age 21, I already have nearly grey hair and have trouble walking. So be happy knowing your uselessness and that a man with a chronic illness would sooner die than live the way you do.",1
9,"People who are incapable and disabled should go to charities that are made specifically for them. Instead, our wonderful government has taken away money from those who earn it and given it to those who haven't. But oh wait, that's being racist. According to our government, you shouldn't judge people at all because everyone is completely equal and exactly the same, and if you say otherwise you're racist. I'd also like to point out that I have lost family members due to welfare. My father dies because we couldn't afford an expensive operation, and I personally (as a math major in college) have don't the math and we could've afforded to save him if not for welfare taxes and minority participation weakening my family business by forcing us to hire incompetent workers. For me it goes beyond being infuriating. It has killed my family.",1
9,"If you can't afford to feed your children you should not have them. An adoption agency will not just give a person a child if they can not prove they can provide for the child. The person has to prove they are capable of raising a child not only financially but prove themselves in other ways. They get screened for criminal history, drugs, and finances. Same should apply to those who want a baby. If you can't afford it don't buy it.",1
9,"Why in America are the poor overweight and lazy? We are the only country that takes better care of those who are lazy then any other.

9,"I have spent the last five years as a city employee who comes in contact with mainly those on welfare. These people have NO desire to get out of their current circumstances. I roll around the poorest areas of the city and see them sitting around drinking on their front porch around working hours with their pajamas still on. No need to get dressed when everyday is Saturday. They wait at ATMs around midnight for their checks to hit. The crime and increases around the first of the month, due to their recent source of money. More booze and drugs makes for more 911 calls. They never marry and have more kids then the average married couple. Then claim their young children are disabled so they get a check for that also. For example, I've heard them tell me they get money for their kids because they have ADD or bipolarism, which cannot be quantitatively measured. EBT cards, Free cell phones, free apartments, free utility vouchers from taxpayers. If the general public saw what I saw they would be shocked. Most never have and never will see it first hand. Entire generations raising their kids on the system.",1
9,"Welfare destroys individual strive for success. It instead focuses on gaining from other's work. Hard working immigrants who don't use these services will be just fine while the ones dependent on it will leave in droves back to their home country. Welfare should have ended after WW2, and it's about time.",1
9,"Working parents who lost their jobs should get help until they find another job. People who never worked and keep having babies don't deserve one cent. The father gets the mother with child and then he disappears. If we keep supporting these people, it will only get worse. The solution is not giving them money for nothing. If the government stops the money, they will have to find a job. Least make them work community service at a Walmart wage. Free Medicaid for their kids, no way. Community service will have to cover that also. They know who the father is and unless he is in prison, make him do community service to pay for his children. Provide an area where they can grow a garden. Stop giving free handouts to people who think we owe them. Life is hard for most of us.",1
9,"I think that if you at on welfare you should have to work some government job to receive your check. Stuffing envelopes, cleaning up parks and neighborhoods etc... It would help people in the long run to know they can't just get free money. It would help young people to get an education or they would have to do hard work to get that check.",1
9,"If you can't take care of your child, foster parents will. If you don't work, you don't eat. If you want a cell phone, go to work. If you want a good paying job, go to school. While at school focus on classes not trying to get a shoe deal in sports. If the government said no new welfare starting in 2015 would you be ready?",1
9,"there are no consequences for making poor choices in our welfare system, quite the opposite, poor choices are rewarded. For a large portion of those who live off our welfare system they think little of where the money comes from or how they will manage without it. It always comes and is not likely to end. Having more children without the means to support them is nothing to worry about, and can even be quite beneficial, they will receive more food stamps, larger monthly checks, larger homes or apartments and all the free health care they need. Nothing about the current system deters people who can not afford one child from having more? I get that it is not for the parent it is for the child however those who receive it don't usually see it that way. We have created a cycle of generations who know no other way of life, they are second and third generation recipients. How is that 'helping' anyone? It is not about 'education', most of the people on 'the dole' don't want to be educated on birth-control, gaining employment and bettering their lives for the sake of their children. The number of years they spend living on tax dollars and continuing to have more kids is proof of that. What is needed is consequences. there should be no additional support for additional children. I never got a raise when I chose to have another child, I needed to determine if it was feasible or not based on what I was earning. I don't want to see children go hungry or without a roof but I can assure you that there are many children being raised in such a manner and their parent(s) do receive welfare, the money is just not spent on what it was meant to be spent on. I am not against welfare and to be fair there are many mothers who needed welfare for whatever reasons but rose above it through hard work. I am against welfare as a way of life and a welfare system that rewards irresponsible actions. We need a system that requires those who receive welfare to be required to give back to their community. there are many things that they could do for example city and county work such as cleaning parks, part-time work where their 'wage' is paid for the employer through the government, providing child care for those who are working for their welfare checks. I am sure that those who collect would be quite upset if they found out they had to work for it but it seems to me to be a much more fair system then handouts. As a bonus if they really hated the job they were given maybe they would find one they like and become self-sufficient. Anything is possible.",1
9,"I am 19 years old, college student, I work long hours and I don't receive any type of government help . I work hard so that other people will eat from my check, this is unfair!! My neighbors in section 8 party all night, smoke, have many children. They don't deserve the help.",1
9,"As i know a lot of job is low pay, and sometime dad or mom have to stay home to take care their children. And I think welfare is for someone who willing to work, and we should have a system that there is no welfare for who without job over 5 three years and we should keep children away these people because they are not going to care about their children, they will not care about their children future. I think it will be good to keep children away from these lazy parent because we don't want children end up like their lazy parent.",1
9,"I have heard all the arguments, and to be honest I'm tired of it. Children shouldn't suffer yes. Guess what, you had them so take care of them. Get out a newspaper. Work the night shift and have someone take care of them while you work to support them. The biggest issue I have with welfare is that it encourages people to be lazy and to not take care of their own responsibilities. The children suffer and people say because they will starve that welfare should go on. People say that because some people actually need it, which is true but their are too many that abuse it. It costs too much, and it's time to put the money into programs that will take down poverty in our country. Kids will start taking school a lot more seriously when they realize that their parents aren't collecting checks anymore and aren't able to manipulate or get free handouts from others tax dollars. it's unfair and taxpayers are tired of working just to take care of those who won't row for the shore. We've heard the complaints from those who want it to continue, but they are easily resolved: Kids won't starve if parents work and do their jobs as parents. People will make ends meet with a job that pays better. If they can't work, they should have to provide proof of their disability and I'm talking about asthma or diabetes or back pain. What do you think the pioneers did that started this country. They worked through blood, sweat, and tears. No more programs for helping unless they are highly regulated and are temporary. Not interested in paying for laziness and excuses anymore",1
9,"Since 1965, when the war on poverty began, their has not been a decrease in those receiving welfare. If you need it, it is very difficult to get off of it because of the rules in place. Do we really want to trust the government to regulate anything since they can't regulate themselves? How did humanity survive before welfare?",1
9,"I'm not in favor of a program that encourages greed, entitlement, and laziness. While some people are genuinely in need of assistance, their is too much corruption in this system. Tax dollars are being spent on the wrong organizations. People should take pride in their ability to succeed on their own and with their own God given talents and abilities. I teach and I always encourage students to do their best because I see what ignorance and laziness gets you. it's time to stop spending money that is just being thrown away to people who easily earn it.",1
9,"I just saw at the grocery store, a women, dressed in ""new"" pink fashionable trendy clothes, buying food with food stamps then get into her Lexus... It utterly pisses me off.... Also she was buying junk food and alcohol with cash (which I know they sell food stamps for a cash amount) and with the stamps things she should've been buying... Then she has the gaul to ask the guy bagging her groceries to grab things for her in line (not even lifting a finger to get it herself...) Oh and another rant, she actually shopped when a bunch of people were in line holding up people... The poor are so entitled... Maybe I should start being unemployed and get the benefit of my taxes. it's bullshit. My parents when they came to this country with less then $100 could have used gov't assistance, my mom said ""NO"" because she said ""once on welfare, always on welfare"" and it's true!",1
9,"Most of the people saying no are on welfare I bet! While they are on their iphone!!! Welfare should only pay for one thing food!!! Welfare should not be paying to get your kids braces when sit on the couch at home all day!! For a fact I know two parents who work 40 hours a week each, and can't afford to get their kid braces!! And I'm not talking 40 hours working at mcdonalds, I'm talking PE. Teacher, publisher for big newspaper. And still can't afford it! Welfare should be set to just small amounts of food, or no welfare at all!",1
9,"I'm sick of people taking money from my paycheck that don't deserve it. If somebody on welfare isn't applying for jobs EVERY DAY, they are a slug; end of story. We need to accept the fact that most people on welfare aren't having trouble finding a job, they just don't want to work.",1
9,"No, welfare should not be eliminated entirely, but the system should be changed drastically. Able-bodied people who can work should be required to work. Even most so-called ""disabled"" people could do some kind of work. In the other column, one of the arguments asks, ""What would Jesus do?"" Well, excuse me, but we have separation of church and state in this country, so what Jesus would do is irrelevant. Also, several arguments talk about ""children."" Why should I be responsible for supporting children I didn't produce? Granted, no one wants to see children starve-- but welfare recipients should be required to use birth control or be sterilized so that they don't produce any MORE children that they can't support. One woman described how her family fell on hard times when her husband lost his job, and they had to apply for food stamps. That's fine. People like her, who fell into hardship through no fault of their own and are struggling to get back on their feet, deserve help and should receive it. The same goes for people who honestly are disabled to the point that they can't make enough to live on. However, people who are simply lazy and ""gaming the system"" should NOT be helped. As one commenter said, such people should be told, ""You want help? Here's a shovel.""",1
9,"The basic point is that we shouldn't have to waste our money on people who won't work. I do understand that some people have handicaps and can't work, but I'm talking about those fully capable people who stand on street corners with signs saying I'm homeless and I need money. In other countries I would understand it's difficult to find a job, but America is not like them. Try anywhere. The local gas station, grocery store, malls, literally anywhere! In this country anything is possible and so there's no need to beg for money because those people have the choice to pick themselves up and make a living for themselves. And please don't bring Jesus into this. I am a Catholic who goes to church every week. Our priests have specifically told us not to give money to people who hold up homeless signs because the church does provide food for those who come and are in need.",1
9,"From a medium wealth family, I understand what having a tight budget means. Even though I am young, my mother is willing to work THREE jobs in order to support me and my brother through college. If she were to do this, a large chunk of her money would go to welfare programs in her taxes. My mother lives with chronic migraines, she gets them every other day and is WILLING to work hard for my benefit.

I also worked a part time job during half of high school. I'm not on welfare. So to those who think they are disabled or think their disability is a big deal, it probably isn't. their are jobs for everything and everyone. Same with education. Before you consider living off the government because of anxiety, bipolar, adhd, etc. remember there are people like me with actually disabilities who do fine without.",1
9,"The major issue is that the government is not charitable In their financial support of poor families. The government 'donates' money that isn't theirs, it's the American taxpayers. A government cannot be charitable because all the money it gets comes from individuals. Therefore for the government to demand more money than it needs, as they do to get funds to support the poor, they are simply extorting the American taxpayer. If you support welfare this is the question, how much of my earnings are you entitled to and why?",1
9,"I think that government assistance should NOT be taken away because what about the people who actually aren't ""useless trash of america"". their are families that are out of jobs and looking extremely hard to find one but how exactly are they gonna keep a roof over their heads and food in their mouths until they become financially stable? However i do think that deeper evaluations should be taken to ensure that no manipulation by the citizens are going on.",1

9,"I spent 1 year on welfare, got on my feet, and got off. It should be their for temporary help, but I'm so tired of the abuse. I had 2 kids and realized I could not afford anymore, so I used the free birth control available at the Planned Parenthood. That's still around, right? So, when I see welfare families with 3, 4, 5 or more kids, I am enraged. I don't feel like it's a violation of your human rights to limit the amount of people the government supports if you don't practice self control. Limiting the amount of children our taxes support by giving the mother a choice of tubal ligation on a 2nd child she cannot afford to raise is a perfect solution.",1
9,"I have worked for this country for over 30 years and I'm ashamed at how government assistance has been handled over the years. This systems needs more than an overhaul it needs to be replaced. Everyone should be required to resubmit and pass strict guidelines to receive any aid. After reading the comments I'm amazed at all of the welfare supporters. I'm sorry someone lost their job, their house or their care. But there are several options available as long as they are willing to buckle down and live within their means. That being said, stop trying to drive a luxury care, live in an expensive house, feed all your friends and relatives and just provide for your immediate family. It has pissed me off repeatedly when I see young adults on welfare. The government needs to require person within 18 yrs - 36 yrs to serve in any branch of service before receiving assistance of any kind. That way they'll receive housing, food, and health care, but also work and pay taxes. Oh and baby factories girls, the military has child care. Problem solved. I forgot to mention I'm a Retired Military Woman, divorced with two kids, that I supported them on my own.",1
9,"Destroy the current system and rebuild it with more controls, less loopholes, more auditing, and stricter rules. The system is too easy to cheat and it's a compounding problem as cheaters teach others how to take advantage of the government.

The more kids you have the more benefits you get, great reason to have kids. Seen too many expensive cars in section 8 housing with many new flat screen TVs, Jordans for the kids, etc. Over 100 million on welfare, my guess is the majority are taking advantage of the system.

I work and go to college to better my life, they just sleep till noon and receive $1000 a month. it's wrong you get paid more for not working then if you were working. A parent is responsible for providing for their children financially, if they can't take care of themselves they don't need their child. They need to start taking responsibility for themselves, get off drugs, and work like the rest of us. If you won't respect yourself, then how can you expect others too",1
9,Plenty of people live on minimum wage. I know I do. I should not have to pay for someone's laziness to go out and get a job. Employers are desperate to find honest workers.

Something has to give, and sadly it will be the ruin of the United States economy. Agree some people actually need it, but that need is far less than we think.

9,The welfare system is allowing people to live a life without contributing to society.

9,"The concept is is good idea. But unfortunately most of the people on welfare are in the category of lazy junkies and because of them the system is a failure. I do feel bad for the ones that do truly need it, but those people are few and far between. A good solution is to drug test welfare recipients.

The military is always a good option. their are usually lots of civil service opportunities. Food service is a quick way to get back on your feet.

I've watched many neighborhood kids faced with the decision of having to work for a living, get pregnant and have a couple kids instead, that's an instant boost of income with no loss. They didn't have to pay for the hospital bills, the government pays them more money for every kid they pop out, and to boot then they qualify for more money to get state or federal funded housing. All at the expense of the taxpayer. And instead of humbling them with food stamps we put all our hard earned welfare money on a nice credit card for them so they can feel good about ripping off the taxpayer. I am so sick and tired of watch my hard earned money going to support those too lazy to work. I am 52 years old and have never been without a job since I was 17 years old. I have to take drug tests to stay employed and pay taxes. I realize that their are honest people out their that have fallen on hard times and need some help, but welfare was not meant to be a career choice. Unfortunately that's exactly what's become for many. I think anyone on or applying for welfare should be drug tested monthly, and if your dirty you're don't. their should also be limits set to how many babies these baby factories are going to get benefits for. Two maximum sounds like a good number. And to get the recipients of welfare accustom to ways of the working world, they should be required to work a minimum of 32 hours for the community. Cleaning toilets, picking up trash, clearing brush and vegetation all sound pretty easy to me. Also to aid them in entering the workforce they will be required to show documentation along with phone numbers of establishments where they have sought employment. it's simple really, nothing for free and nothing to drug abusers who just want to get high and get paid for it.",1
9,I am working to get my way through college debt free so that I can have a good life for myself some day. I should not have to pay for lazy people with way more children than they can support. I should be keeping this money so that I can get through college and not end up in poverty.,1
9,"Ya know, if we all were on welfare, how would our country even be the same? Lets say we did all just stop working cause we were too lazy to work... Do you people like to eat? Too bad cause their would be no grocery stores and the food you stored would be gone and you would be too lazy to make a garden or something like that, you like your home? Uh ohs that's going to be gone too because there would be no home inspectors or carpenters or construction workers to fix your house so now their will be more homeless people.. Do you like to be safe? Not gonna happen, there would be no law enforcement to keep order and their would be riots and a lot of people would die... What about if you are not feeling so good, well you might die because there would be no hospitals to help you. Those are just a few examples.... Oh and by the way...I'm only 17 years old and I'm working harder than some of the people in obama's america....",1
9,"We need to educate people more on how much it costs to support kids. Stats are overwhelming that families with kids and elderly need welfare to survive. We need to teach people how much money is required to support children and also do more to teach people about retirement. it's not that us ""working"" people are jealous that welfare people get to do nothing. it's just upsetting that some of us who planned better have to pay for those who didn't. Disabled and people who truly cannot work do deserve help, but for anyone who can work, please plan ahead.",1
9,"I have been in the medical field for 25 years and 98% of people on government assistance.. Smoke, drink and have the best electronic equipment. They have money for food but choose to spend it on other things. I'm tired of supporting deadbeats, regardless of their situation, the ones that need help don't qualify.",1
9,there's birth control for a reason. Yet many people continue to have kids they KNOW they cannot afford. I know birth control can fail but the more you use the better. Use birth control AND a condom. And possibly something else with it (female condom or spermicide). When someone has low income that's a sign they should not be having kids or not yet (until they have at least a good amount saved up as a starting boost). there's abortion and adoption by the way. And for those who keep having kids they cant afford yet are against abortion...Well they shouldn't be complaining about their struggling. They can't have it both ways. And then there's those who choose not to work. Welfare needs to stop so they can learn some lessons and responsibility for their mistakes they chose to risk.,1
9,"See i can understand keeping it around for wounded or the people who can't physically work but for the people who sit all day and do nothing no that i have a problem with. To many people on the welfare system aren't trying to get a new job, most are just sitting and living off of the government. All just sitting who can work, i have no pity for.",1
9,"Welfare wasn't even enacted until 1935. People survived before then and they will survive after it is gone. If you're truly in an uncontrollable bad financial statement people either friends, family, or non-profits such as churches will help you out. If people are taxed less they will probably be more inclined to give to charities that help people who hit bad times. I know I consider my taxes a donation, so if I wasn't taxed so heavily then I would give more of my income to charity.",1
9,"it's my freaking money. I don't want to be forced to give it to people. With the way things are now, a percentage my of paycheck goes to support those who don't actively do for themselves. For whatever reason, I simply don't care. If I'm going to give money, I want to choose who I give to. The bottom line is if I make the money, I should decide where it goes.",1
9,"Cash welfare should be taken away. Not food stamps. People do still need to eat, as much as I don't particularly like it (supporting these people not working), either. Cash welfare is BY FAR abused the most. Here is my best take on this... LEAVE IT TO PRIVATE CHARITIES AND CHURCHES TO SUPPORT AND FEED THE TRULY NEEDY, STARVING AND HOMELESS.",1
9,"From time to time I shop at a local Michoacana meat market, because all of us who have to live on a budget shop for the best deals, and could not help but notice on more than one occasion the form of payment some people were using. I noticed the first time how a well dressed couple with heavy gold jewelry paid their purchase of over $100 with a Lonestar card and had to pay, I believe a difference of with cash, as they had their wallet out I noticed that they pulled out one $100 dollar bill among many other $100 bills, to pay a $5 difference. I was shocked to see such well dressed people with jewelry needing government assistance. To top this off, I even saw them get into a 2012-2014 vehicle. Since then I have paid attention to the from of payment of everyone as I am in line as well and am relieved to see the hard working people pay cash, but aside from that being said I do see a big trend of Lonestar abuse in this store. Same story as I previously mentioned, well off people pay with lonestar cards and pay differences of a couple of dollars while their wallets are full of big bills. It is a big problem and will only get worse if people feel they can get away with this from of abuse. I have heard as well, through talk with acquaintances that the most popular thing to do is rent out lonestar cards and even sale. We cannot help those who cannot help themselves, or for in this case abuse of the help given. As for my wife and I, we hold ourselves from enjoying nights out and other shopping privileges because we have priorities, but it bothers me that we sacrifice in order for others to enjoy our tax money. I myself work tirelessly everyday in order to pay my bills, pay for childcare, pay for diapers, school loans and help pay for my wife's university tuition all to one day be great citizens of our Texas. And I do it all with pride and without assistance. Now granted there's people who do need assistance but these abusers are holding up the line. I say wipe it all out and start fresh and screen each one to the bottom, if they can afford expensive clothes, cars, and enjoy finer things then those don't need help.",1
9,"I have worked in all fields catering to people on welfare. From firefighting, to police, to the Emergency Room. If you think that majority of people don't abuse the system you are wrong! Heck, I was wrong myself. I am a believer that a society is only as strong as how well they take care of their week. However, it has become those who work hard for a living are the ones who are weak now while those on welfare reap the benefits. Now, I do believe there are many people who need assistance, and typically it should only be temporary. But everyday I see people who have never had a job in their lives with fancy cars, nice home, ipads, ipods, and coach purses. I saw a woman on medicaid, unemployed, in the ED who was their because the breast plants she got that week were hurting! It is sickening that so many people can abuse the system and blatantly not care how it affects hard working Americans.",1
9,To start off don't tell me I need to be educated because I just wrote a 15 page research paper on the welfare systems and the bad effects. It is a load of crap honestly.The only people that believe that the welfare system isn't bad are the people that are on it or have close family members on it. It helps in very few cases for people that need it. On average there are more people that abuse the welfare system then not.there are plenty of reasons why it is a load of crap,1
9,"2013 the government spent 131.9 BILLION dollars on welfare users.. That should end this debate right here. Also, if that wasn't convincing enough it is the younger generation 18-29 that are all over welfare... Why, why must you be on welfare?! I am so sick of paying for these lazy kids that just take handouts without ever earning anything I believe it is bad parenting but their shouldn't be more people on welfare then there's people who are holding down full time jobs.. That just means the people that are actually working is picking up the extra slack. I get it, everyone needs help every once in a while which is why I think they should get bare minimum and can only use once in their life for no more than a month. Instead, they are being paid MORE than MINIMUM WAGE. Maybe I'm soulless but WHO CARES if someone else eats tonight, maybe I'm self centered but as long as my family eats I don't want to pick up the extra burden of caring if someone else that I don't know eats. I think everyone tends to forget about the trillions upon trillions of dollars that our Nation is in, we have to eventually pay it back and we could pay it back a whole lot quicker if we cut welfare out of the picture and focused the budget on something that actually mattered like paying off this debt, rebuilding cities, better schools, hell if they can't think of anything to do with it give it back to the people who actually put forth the work to get a job, sustain that job, and sometimes get promoted in that job. there should be no excuse as to why more people are living off of welfare then actually working. It drives me NUTS to see how spoiled we are making people. Honestly, I can't imagine people who are struggling ends meet and need to stay on welfare, it is called get a grant or scholarship, get a part time job to be able to survive while getting your education and actually try to get a better job. I'm twenty, own my own house, two vehicles, two motorcycles, two dogs, a baby on the way, married, and no mommy and daddy didn't buy me a damn thing I worked my ass off for every little thing I have... Why in the hell can't everyone else?!?!?! Oh I forgot, they're lazy.",1
9,"Abuse is rampant. The system is broken and should be scrapped. I see abuse everyday by many not just a few. When people are given free stuff the become unmotivated to work. A new program should be started to allow only basic necessities and no more. No cash payout at all. These people should not be allowed to get earned income credit either. They should have to pay taxes like everyone else and never, ever get back more than they paid in. Phones should be limited to 60 minutes per month if allowed at all and anyone caught abusing the system should be kicked off the program forever. Enough is enough.",1
9,I can't except the fact that people are creating a poor trend for the future of the kids. I never had welfare and nether did my family they all worked for a living saving every last dime. Family showed us if you want to get somewhere you have to get up and go make it happen. Nowadays people what the easy way out I'd rather help out disabled and handicap not a strong young man baby popping women and lazy people. If they want help help yourself handouts are for those who can't mobley do a thing,1
9,I work hard for my money. Why should some people not have to work and still get money. If you are that poor stop having kids and smoking and going out all the time. What would they do if they did not have a crutch.... WORK. This is just nuts.,1
9,"While I agree that their are people who need the help I also see too many of those that abuse the system. These people will happily tell you that it just makes more sense for them to collect their handouts then it does to work. I believe that the help should be temporary and that they should use that opportunity to improve their lives. I hated the fact that all I could get were low paying jobs so you know what I did.. I went back to school.. Granted I received help with my tuition but I did not use more then I needed, busted my butt, and I got my degree in a reasonable amount of time.. Once I had my degree I GOT A JOB.. Simple as that. I was thankful for the help but I put myself in a position to hopefully never need it again. That's what welfare should be, a helping hand, not a way of life. 90 percent of the time it is a way of life. This is what we are tired of. Our money is being taken to help those that are ""unfortunate"" and they act like it's not a big deal..I Like it is be expected that no matter what choices they make, no matter how far they fall the government will be their.. What they forget is that it is NOT the government that is helping them it is us. It is those of us that get up at the crack of dawn and work 12+ hours a day 5-6 days a week.. You Know what.. I'm going to works ass off.. Save all I can ... Sell my house.. And stop working.. Wonder what everyone on welfare would do if the money stops at the source..",1
9,America was founded by hard working people that's what made this country great. The government somehow got the idea that it needed to take money from the hard working people and give it to the poor and enabled. This in turn set the stage for the lazy people to start taking advantage. Why should we have to pay for people to be lazy and we the taxpayers have nothing to say about it . This is an abuse of power by the government.,1
9,We are spending way to much money on welfare. If you are on welfare you should have to take a drug test every month because half of these people spend their (our) money on drugs and don't use it to help themselves out of poverty. If no action has been taken to get a job then welfare should stop in 25 weeks.,1
9,"I've seen too many times the abuse that is taken place in the welfare system. Just the other day, I saw a lady pay for her groceries in food stamps. Then, she's loads those groceries into a brand new Cadillac, what's wrong with that picture!?! Why should I work hard for my money only to see it get taken out of my pocket and put into some low life, lazy, bottom feeder who feels like the government owes him/her something! Get off you ass, get a job and work like the rest of us!",1
9,"I have fallen on hard times. Yes I have been on unemployment. Yes I have worked hard for what I have and will get. I don't want lazy people to get anything. If you roll up to the welfare office in a care/suv that costs almost the same as my house. Sell it and live on that with a bicycle for transport. You got a 3 pack a day habit? $25 a day freed up if you quit. Nails or hair cut at the salon? $60-100 freed up if you do it yourself. it's called doing what is necessary to survive. The ""WWJD"" person. You get what you give true. But read the full story and find that they value a hard days work for little reward. I have know folks with Master's degree working for minimum wage because they had to. They weren't waiting on that 120k/yr break. Don't end welfare completely because yes. Some need it. But make it mandatory for it to be thoroughly investigated before it is given. Too hard? Kill the welfare system and leave them up to the charity of the family and community. Not the whole country. Then again. I have gone to bed hungry while my children have not...I used scissors to cut my hair enough I could shave my head to save on shampoo. And I have had nothing to my name but my family and their love. Though I have been poor in money. I am rich in family. Stop wasting my hard earned money on people who drive cars I can't afford and have endless luxuries I can't experience. No free lunch or ride anymore. You want your government check? Mandatory 3 miles road litter detail. Or pick fruit. Or laundry at a prison. Do something that makes the community better. Entitlement is bullshit.",1
9,"For those of you that worked and continue to work for everything you have. Work harder, millions of Americans on welfare are depending on you!

9,Once you fight for this country and see that people who have not don't anything other then use a system get faster treatment and coverage then the veterans administration.

9,"Why should taxpayers (hardworking middle and lower-class, and even the not so hardworking wealthy) have their money go to lazy bums. Of course, after having read some of the ""no-sayers,"" we should think of the needs of children and we should be grateful for what we have. But that is beside the point. We MUST not allow our tax money to go to waste. If someone wants a job, let them look for one. If they deserve to get a job, they'll get it within the time their unemployment benefits end. If they don't have a job, chances are (and this is a HUGE chance) that they are not trying and decided they will live the rest of their lives off of hard-working Americans' money. If we allow welfare to continue, then their is no point in working. Why don't we all just not go to work and live off of the government? BECAUSE we are Americans. We are capitalists who believe in democracy and republicanism; the right and ability to build oneself up. Otherwise, we would be socialists, living in a society where everyone trusts their government to make their decisions for them and whose concept of government goes against everything the United States stands for.",1
9,I know people need money. However it's wrong that food stamps can buy junk food. If you need free food there should be a list. I hate having $20 until lay day to buy a few items and they have 3 baskets full FOR FREE. I think they should only get fruits vega milk and bread. I hate seeing McDonalds accept EBT. I hate working when they get it for free for a lifetime. If you need free food go to a food bank. None of this free range in the grocery store. it's not fair to us who work . If you do have welfare I think you need to be mandated to work as a substitute teacher or some volunteer work. All they want is one drug test and you're too lazy to do that. I do know some people need it but it should be for a limited time.,1
9,"I hate how people abuse the system, and the only way for them to stop is to just get rid of it and see the outcome. I bet you from their on you'd see the ones that had the capability of getting a job and the ones who truly needed the extra help",1
9,"I have a couple points I'd like to make about welfare in this country, why we should get rid of it, how we should get rid of it, and what would replace it. First we should get rid of welfare, because it creates dependency. I know that sounds cliche among a lot of conservatives and libertarians, but it's true. The epitome of this is the Indian reservations which are a humongous welfare state. it's also very costly, and it sucks a lot of money out of our economy that could used to reinvest in to creating new capital or new jobs. How we should get rid of it? We have to do this slowly. I would suggest we replace the current giant entitlements with a healthcare voucher that would create a market for low income people to buy health insurance. I would use cash subsidies as a means to an end. I would eliminate in kind programs first like food stamps or public housing. Those should not be their. You also have to at the same time, invest money in education and deregulate the economy so that people can invest in themselves rather then having other people invest in other people that are idle. Some deregulation that you can perform is abolishing occupational licensing, getting rid of the minimum wage, get rid of regulations that benefit large corporations and eliminate corporate subsidies. You have to deregulate first otherwise you're going to have a lot of poor people with no money, and they can't go get money. That's a problem. What would replace welfare? The simple answer is charity. During the 1800s charity served a vital role in our society through mutual aid societies which could formed again. People would have more money at their disposal if you cut taxes, and they would have the option to give to charities that are trustful, and efficient with their resources. Also with higher production and better education their will be less poor people. And there's my answer.",1
9,There's no reason to be on welfare. There's many forms of birth control that someone can use. it's common sense that children are expensive so make sure you can feed them first. Not just welfare but all the tax credits out their. Most people just wait for their handout at tax time.,1
9,"I've been working hard for the past 6.5 years since I got out of college. It is so unfair to see people given food stamps for free. their are always ads in my local paper for job openings.

I've also seen how people come in dressed to wear I work asking for a job app.",1
9,"Children that grow up under welfare, don't learn the meaning of work and often end up themselves under welfare. If it crazy that in America some families are going on to a 3rd and 4th generation living completely on welfare - 3 or 4 generations within the same family cannot get work? Really? Work breeds work. Work breeds success. Living under hardship does not make you a victim. Many of the greatest humans ever to live grew up under hardship but none grew up under welfare.",1
9,Allow an individual to receive welfare as long as they are in school or in a job placement program. They should be given benefits for a maximum of 7 seven years.

My mother and father have worked very hard and came to this country with nothing. My mom went to college (while working) to supply her children with a better life. Now, do you think it's fair to give someone that is perfectly OK a check every month for doing nothing. I work at a grocery store and I see people with EBT (SNAP) cards buying sushi, chocolate, etc. Then in the next transaction, which is a 12 pack of beer, they pay cash. Like what I'm about to say sounds very mean but if you can't afford a kid, don't have one. it's that simple. don't have an iphone, luxury care, or jewelry. If you can't pay for food, you shouldn't have those items. People need to get to work, and make jobs if there aren't any.",1

Now there are worse racial tensions than ever before only now it is justified and supported because it is politically correct. The more money thrown into the war on poverty the worse the problem has gotten. I'm not contributing anymore. I'm not going to be stepped on by someone that refuses to even try but feels they have a right to take from others. I'm avoiding high paying professional work and am going to earn as little as I need to get by. Notice how I said I am not going to sign up for government handouts like some social parasite. I'm going to earn for myself. Worse of all is the arrogance of those that feel justified to steal from me because they are somehow enlightened enough to cure social injustices. So they commit outright theft from me and call me greedy. That arrogance is truly unfathomable.,1

9,"Let's be honest. Many people are on welfare because their IQ is deficient to do anything but the most rudimentary work, which pays less than what government benefits provide. To qualify for government benefits, they shamelessly bear illegitimate children -- the more children, the bigger the check. So near-imbeciles exponentially produce more near-imbeciles, none capable of functioning at school or employment. And so generation after generation collects by breeding. These are the inarticulate, mindless mobs robbing stores, selling drugs, or assaulting strangers playing the ""knockout game."" Born with little more then the instinct to survive, they maraud the streets because they can do little else. Society is inadvertently subsidizing a criminal class that destroys civilization, as has happened in Detroit. Time to set aside the illusory idealism and recognize welfare for the evil it is.",1
9,"I would like to personally apologize to each and every one of you working middle class folks who are in the courtroom today to watch the gavel fall upon me. A judgment for child support does not only affect just myself, this woman, this child. It affects all of you sitting here today. You may not even realize it but I do and I am ashamed of my actions because I have taken money from all of you hard working people. I have enslaved everyone of you by taxation. The child support industry, the welfare industry all sucks the life out of the middle class. That is it's design... I fell victim to love and lust and at the end of the road I have damaged my relationship with all of you. Despite the fact that I make 40$ an hour and over $1200 dollars gets taken from me every month. (14,400 per year) I work so hard... I never see my child. I am a slave and have made slaves out of all of you... You see in the end when my x girlfriend stays at home receiving her welfare check relaxing enjoying the nice weather and the 14,400 I pay per year. All those extra government benefits equal to around 14,000 a year on top of what I pay. The reason I am so remorseful for my actions is because I have endangered all of you in an indirect path of taxation the 14,000 in subsidies that the government pays her in wic, food stamps and low income housing that she rents out. That money is divided by all of you. I know you don't realize this because I never did, I was too busy working trying to live the American dream. Now all I have is a college education 60,000 dollars in school loans and over 45% of my check going to taxes and obama care. I am an enabler because I failed to protect myself. How could I have know that I was just a meal ticket, I thought she actually loved me. In these difficult economic times, we must not worry about our life but the lives of everyone else working. You see only after losing everything can a person truly see the bigger picture, they weren't after my money, they were reaching into your pockets all along. As I sit here starving and homeless at the local library in downtown Richmond Ca it all makes sense to me. This was their plan, to turn the middle class against the poor. They will never break my spirits because being middle class is the feeling of acceptance and not at all about how much money we make. As a social being we are equal what divides us from one another, is only what they say divides us. Don't give up hope, it's the last thing they can take from you.",1

I know not everyone had the chance to, but they can still try now and they don't.

9,"The ""American Dream,"" at its birth, referred to the beautiful possibility for all immigrants to give of themselves, to work, and to make money in return to support themselves and their families. Even more beautiful, there was no cap on how successful you could be; with effort comes reward. This philosophy placed importance on hard work, determination, and responsibility. In most cases, it is hard work, determination, and responsibility that the welfare system destroys. Along with these values, the American Dream itself is destroyed. Why do so many blindly and easily throw away the values that have made us so great? The other and incredibly important problem with the welfare system is the vile injustice. Hard working people across the nation have money taken from their pockets and placed into others', and the hard working have no control in the matter. It is arguably militaristic. And although the working people pay into the system, they don't reap the benefits. Even worse, illegal immigrants are granted welfare benefits every day. Not only are they non-tax-payers, but they are non-citizens! I currently work full-time and cannot afford health insurance - even post-ACA roll out. It is disgusting but almost comical that I will now pay an additional fine as well! Leaders and fellow citizens of this nation need to get off the ""trendy"" liberal train and realize that it is time to defend our own people and our dying values. The United States of America will cease to be a hub of growth, freedom, determination and prosperity if we continue to REWARD people for doing the WRONG things. Anyone familiar with the prisoner's dilemma? Unless the welfare system is changed (or ideally abolished,) the hard working people will soon throw up their hands and prove their worth to the nation the hard way. Let's not let it get to this point. Let's work instead to motivate those who are currently merely drains on society.",1

They should just be given food to not starve.",1
9,"Providing food stamps, Section 8 housing, Welfare checks, etc. have produced no tangible benefit to any society. The only thing it does is provide a short term solution to a long term problem. My issue with liberal policy is that is uses money as a problem solving tool, but what if the problem isn't financial? In the poor communities the problem is cultural. They have either failed to assimilate to the pre-existing culture or in the case of the African American community, they have rejected it. The other main problem with welfare is that it enables laziness. You don't get the most out of people by giving them free money. It is a pretty simple relationship and has been proven as the number of those on food stamps have expanded dramatically. I now see people on the subway talking openly about food stamps. Using these provisions should be an embarrassment and not a fact of life. We are stripping people of not only their pride but their adult independence. Aside from my philosophical disagreement, I haven't seen any evidence that these programs work. All I see is our government throwing money into the sewer. These programs also create racism and class warfare as taxpayers resent all bottom feeders. This is especially true now as the middle class can barely get by in metro areas. Bottom line - let people find their way to prosperity or let them fail. I am confident that people will succeed when such safety nets are removed. A hungry dog hunts best!",1
9,"it's wrong when a friend of mine who CHOOSES not to work, gets more money in handouts then I do when I work 40 hours a week, paying rates, and running a care. He gets free gym, free dental, free train travel, free accommodation, and reduced other amenities. I know women who admitted to me they purposely got pregnant and become benefit mums just because it's a more luxurious lifestyle choice. All these people have holidays, laptops, games consoles, latest mobile phone contracts, big TV's, and gadgets. So it's a strange situation in society where the people who contribute to society, the ones in dead end minimum wage jobs, are less well off and less privileged then those who choose to milk the system.",1
9,"You can choose to donate to the homeless, and you can choose to give all of your money away, but it is not the government's right and/or job to give money to the poor. Of course, there has to be some blanket and safety net for the extreme poor, but unless you are working your ass off all day every day to support your family like the millionaire CEOs that are paying for your son's new xbox did, you don't have the right to take other's money; they worked for it (most of them). So get off of your ass, stop smoking pot, and get a job (because their are homeless shelters and services to that will help you).

9,"I go to school every day to see this one rich looking and acting kid that I know 100% is on welfare. He comes to school every day with his iPhone and talks about all of the stuff that he has. I once asked him why he is on welfare, and he told me that his dad was laid off from a financial firm and that he didn't feel like looking for another job. I told him that his dad could easily get a job in fast food, but he replied that his dad thought about that and said that he wants a real job. When I start working (probably at minimum wage to start with), it makes me feel awful that unemployed, lazy slobs are going to be getting more money from the government then I will be earning. It also makes me angry that some of my money is going to be taken from me to support these people and their wrong doings.",1

9,"Simple as that, also it needs to be limited to 6 months, and limited to what can you buy with it. No tv, no cell phone and NO PRIVILEGE TO VOTE while on welfare. Also, you have to do some kind of public work like sweeping streets or picking up trash around highways minimum 40 hours a week.",1
9,The US needs to seriously cut spending. Obviously the military could be cut by 80-90% if we close down foreign bases and leave the middle east. Drugs could be legalised to reduce the amount of people in prison. Government pensions could be cut as the next generation shouldn't subsidise this generations government workers. This will not be enough. Repealing Obamacare and then fixing healthcare should help cut the costs. One way to fix healthcare is to remove government regulations and allowing companies to operate across states. Once this is all don't then the US credit rating will likely return to AAA reducing the amount of interest that needs to be paid each year as the US seems more likely to repay its obligations. The government can further reduce its deficit by stopping subsidising farms and oil companies. It can reduce the restrictions on building property and acquiring land which will reduce the cost of cheaper homes. Once all of this is don't their may still be need to cut welfare which is why I voted yes.,1

It either needs to be stopped completely or it needs to be only given to those who are worthy of it.,1

9,"This country was founded on hard work! Our founding fathers would be disgusted with the way we handle our business in present times. I'll give you a quick example that I see all too often.... I was waiting inline to buy items (with my hard-earned money from working 2 jobs and going to school) from a local convenience store and I see a woman with 4 children put up nothing but junk food (candy/soda) on the counter and pay approximately $40 with food stamps.... No big deal right? Well, then she proceeds to pull out a wad of 20's and buys $200 worth of $20 scratch-offs and walks out of the store and hops into Cadillac Escalade....WTF?!... The funny part is, I don't blame the people for taking advantage of the system, I blame the government who allows this type of behavior to take place.

9,"To simply put, welfare program of any sort without a good system of check and balance, such as the one we have here in the United State, will create a culture of abuse and laziness. As the people are trained to be lazy, they will train their children to be the same. Once that is don't the workforce would continue to shrink and shrink until one day no one would wants to work. Since no one want to work, there would be no one to pay taxes. If there is no tax revenue, the system collapse. The cripple welfare program we have here in the United State is a self fulfilling prophecy. What we need is a good check and balance system within the program to prevent abuse. Anyone who can work should be put to work to earn that welfare check that you and I are paying for. Happy holiday US citizens.",1

As a Christian I follow God's' word not to beg. it's not right for someone to get a free ride and many people on welfare simply just don't want to work. Want proof? Come to Oahu, and go out anytime during normal working hours. You will see many people who collect a welfare check and blow the money on crap. Why? Because in Hawaii You get $26 an hour for being on welfare, this is not ""help"" it's wasting taxpayer dollars on people who think they don't need to work because why would anyone in the right mind work their tails off for $7 an hour when you can just keep on having kids and pretend to look for a job and Uncle Sam will give $26 an hour? I can spin my opinion to meet in the middle ground as well, put rules in place that stop people from using and abusing the American people, ie. put a limit on how much time a person is allowed to collect a free check, make recipients take drug tests, limit the amount of children people on welfare can have so they can't use their kids as scapegoats. Someone in need shouldn't have 10 kids while they are collecting charity. Bottom line is that their are lazy people out their who have continually screwed it up for people actually in need, it's time for out with the old in with the new.",1
9,"I've only known of two people that actually NEEDED state assistance. One was a father of three whose wife ran off with someone else after he got crushed in a factory, but he only collected around $600/month. He survived by having all the kids work (from his 10-year-old daughter to his 16 year old son) and raiding the expired food at the local Hostess shop. The other was a guy whose wife got bone cancer and they had both worked in fast food most of their lives. But once again, they WORKED previous to the benefits. He only collected so they could have a reasonable place to stay while he took care of her and didn't have to go to some kind of assisted living until she passed away. Now he's a mental wreck but you know what? He's working again. On the flip side, I've worked with a woman who complained to my boss about having TOO MANY HOURS and that it would cut into her state assistance. Her best friend babysits her kids but the state PAYS her to do it! She sold her perfectly running 90's Honda and bought a 2004 Dodge Durango last November, but was too broke to buy her kids a SINGLE CHRISTMAS PRESENT that year. And she's not the only one like that. Out of the 14 apartments in my complex, only 4 actually have people that work. And I'm counting myself and the prostitute that lives upstairs. I take some of them food shopping once in awhile and they piss all their EBT money away on food even they think is absurdly overpriced, like fresh seafood and $7 boxes of crackers. All the state money gets spent on a few necessity food items, the liquor store (I consider myself a drunk too, but at least I work for it), whatever little bills they have (due to housing benefits Obama phones), and for the most part the rest of it gets melted in a little glass tube. And the ones that have kids are no different then the ones that don't. Every time you give birth, you should have to establish someone whose financially responsible enough to have custody of the child, whether on welfare or not! In order to collect welfare, you and everyone in your household should have monthly drug tests (especially if you're collecting for kids), you should have paid at least a certain amount into the system, a reasonably clean criminal history, not be paid PER CHILD, and food stamps should be paid in vouchers. I've never heard of anyone collecting welfare that actually needed it and couldn't survive with those conditions. I barely passed high school, work for barely more than minimum wage, I have my OWN apartment, drink like it's a freakin' sport, bought my pickup for less than a thousand dollars, have a few pets, AND took care of my teenage sister for awhile. And you know what? I get by just fine.",1
9,"Welfare is not bad, but what people don't realize is that it's COMING OUT OF YOUR POCKET. Some people abuse the welfare and decide that they can earn more money doing nothing then working. We need to stop this or we will have more and more people on welfare until the country dies. The people who pay their taxes fund the country. No representation without taxation. I know I said it backwards, but that's my motto. If you don't pay taxes, you shouldn't vote. You should be treated as a non-citizen to encourage you to get a job. That way, no one on welfare can be mad at you because you want to get rid of welfare and kill everyone.",1

But then there's the other guy who blows his checks on Drugs and rims for his care and leaves his kids to starve I say have it but have some restrictions like a drug test and a receipt to prove you're not spending it on idiotic things.Proof that you're trying to get a job may help too,1

That being said trillions of dollars are being spent on the welfare system that could be spent on creating jobs. Instead of mooching off the government mooch get your ass off the couch and try to get a job. there are many support systems in the state that are their to help you. The welfare system is not free money and is hurting the economy and other hard working citizens.

9,"The Welfare Program is a good idea but in practise it's just not working. To many people decline job offers or promotions because if they accept it the government will take them off of welfare. Which means that having welfare and having a lower paying job will give that person more income then not being on welfare and receiving a higher paying job. The government should either change the policies of the Welfare program or not have a Welfare program at all. True the Welfare Program may be a socialist move (in my opinion it is) because it takes away the liberty of the people who are not on welfare, but it doesn't have to be. The government could make it a more charitable gesture rather then a socialist one. there's a quote that I love and I'll paraphrase it, ""If you give a hungry man a fish he'll be full today and hungry tomorrow, but if you teach the man to fish then he'll never be hungry again."" Right now the welfare program is at the give a man fish, but we need to be at the teach a man to fish spectrum. Instead of giving out free money we should use the tax money to help pay for the person's college tuition, the amount received would be based on their GPA. The government could put out propaganda trying to convince people to save money and to slowly develop a two year food storage for when emergency and family crisis occurs. They could use our tax money to have a government. Food warehouse that sells food at a low price, and also employs the unemployed people. The government. Could provide free institutes to teach the people on welfare a basic education (like how to read) or even provide more high school programs for adults. This education system should employ the unemployed people on welfare as they teach other people on welfare basic education. They should make it clear to citizens that when family emergencies do occur the person should ask these people for help in this order family Church or charity organization the government. We should have laws in place prohibiting a person who is not handicapped (etc) and does not have a job or is not trying to get a higher education to be on welfare. This means that the government would need to regulate welfare more carefully, provide more jobs for the unemployed people on welfare. I understand that things happen and the most honest people may go bankrupt, and that sometimes there is no family or charity organisation to turn to and in this case the welfare program may do good for that person. Still I am not and will not agree with people who purposely get stuck on this safety net, it hurts this economy and everyone in it severely. Right now the government's Welfare policies allow people to get stuck on this safety net. These policies need to be changed.",1

Why should this new generation work when their parents or grandparents never worked. The welfare system has gotten out of control and it needs to end.

Today only 10% of the 100% on welfare should be on it. Instead of ""What can I do for my country"" it's ""What can my country do for me"". Welfare has become a generational way of life and has bankrupt this country financially and spiritually. it's not the governments place or responsibility to take care of your every need should you decide to be a highschool dropout, have children, have no self respect, no motivation, or wait til your dream job comes along. Pre welfare people turned to their community, church, family, friends and weren't above taking whatever jobs came their way to get back on their feet which in turn gave them motivation, encouragement, goals, humility, appreciation, confidence. Welfare is no longer what it's intended purpose was. it's encouraged people to be lazy, complacent, abuse the system, a way of life, lack of responsibility and self respect, puppets.

9,"All government welfare should be don't away with. I will agree that some assistance for the disabled and 'down on their' luck demographic sections of society should be provided, but absolutely NOT by the horribly corrupt and inefficient government programs and tax credits/deductions, et cetera. Any assistance should be run and funded directly by the community through churches and non-governmental organizations that exist in the private sector. When the community is involved, the rampant abuses and huge inefficiency of the government in management and disbursement of assistance would be greatly diminished. Another valid option for those supposedly 'unable to find work,' who are really just too proud to accept work that is considered to be of low social standing while reeling in their expenses that result in outlays beyond their financial means, would be non-profit corporations that fulfill government contracts for public works and infrastructure improvement. These non-profits would be cheaper than labor companies working for a profit that consistently underbid and under-perform since there would be no corporate profit motive. Spending fully 1/10th to 1/4th (depending on how you calculate it) of the ENTIRE gross domestic product on managing programs that still fail to provide much benefit for those in need is not working.",1
9,"This welfare system is a heavy burden for the Government. Ideally, this welfare should come from taxation and not Government's own wallet. But today there are less people in the workforce (as reflected by high unemployment ), and those who are, earn less (underemployment, cutting of working hours) or their salary stagnate. In addition, due to low birth rate, their are not enough graduates entering the workforce to replace those who retire. Which translates into less tax revenue and more borrowing to fund this. And the worse part is, because of this welfare system, people will opt not to work, or to retire early, and rely on the unemployment benefits instead. Why should they work if they can support themselves through welfare? This is not their own fault, but it is the system that allows such logic to exist among them. You are working hard, but another person get to enjoy the result. Not what would I call just.",1

It can be a corporation, it can be a single parent with 8 children, or 86 year old on their deathbed to pay medical bills. it's the taking not asking that makes it immoral.

No sympathy here, there are plenty of other alternatives to government welfare like digging food out of Dumpsters for dinner. 70% of landfill waste is food. Perhaps the government could make it so employers actually provided for their workers, by giving a wage that just supports paying of low quality of life? Just a thought.",1

If you can't work because of a real medical condition like paralysis or cancer or something I have no issue helping out but people who use the lame excuse ""I was born poor"" so they go out and have kids they can't afford and continue the fraud of deadbeat lazy losers deserve nothing from our government. If you're on welfare and have another kid we obviously can't make the kid starve for your laziness but we can seize any type of social security you'd get in retirement to repay it. We will seize social security to repay college loans but not to repay laziness fromeople who can't keep their pants on. it's a crime.",1

9,"I grew up poor in America. And I mean the actual ""poor,"" not the ""government assisted poor that allowed you to afford filet and sushi."" I started work as a farm hand when I was 13, I made just enough to feed myself and PURCHASE health insurance. I lived in a 7x7 room in a shared home. I never stole, I never even applied for government assistance. A kid managed to work and provide for himself. A CHILD. I worked my way from their into a restaurant, from their into carpentry, then to a warehouse laborer. Saved money, learned a trade in a technical college, and used my education to get a recession-proof job as a heating and cooling service technician. Ten years later and I now own my own apartment and live just comfortably. If a CHILD can figure out how to do that, what are these fully capable adults doing on welfare? If I ever hear someone say there are ""no"" jobs.. What a joke. their are jobs galore. Maybe you all should rephrase that as ""there are no jobs, that anybody WANTS to do."" Grow up people, sometimes you have to do something you don't want to do to survive. You think I liked that old rusty spade in my hands? Nope. But I did it because I had to. Now we live in a country of selfishness and laziness. I refuse to have children just to spare them from witnessing this country buckle under the weak knees of a 90% dependant population. I know first hand over a dozen people who are ""poor."" They have cell phones' internet, cars, and too much time on their hands. How naive do you have to be to not see that the amount of people collecting are a million times greater than the amount of people who actually NEED it. I don't say get rid of it, I say fix it. Drug tests aren't mandatory? Are you serious? Physical and mental testing not required? I hear these african american immigrants in the store the other day complaining they can't afford the expensive diapers because the government won't give them enough money.

9,"Abuse is common. it's a well known fact so I'll skip that part. The existence of a support system that guarantees someone who works 40+ hours a week and someone who does nothing at all receive the same comforts facilitates a system of sloth. Welfare if it exists should be much harder to receive, should have a hard deadline to it's benefits unless the individual is incapacitated. I don't mean depressed or injured I mean incapacitated. If you can still do basic math with a calculator then work and if you just don't want to then you don't deserve anything from anyone and should stop leeching off of those who do busy their hump.",1
9,"Welfare was established during the Great Depression. 100% of the people that were on welfare were American and in life or death dire need and it was TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE. Today only 10% of the 100% on welfare should be on it. Instead of ""What can I do for my country"" it's ""What can my country do for me"". Welfare has become a generational way of life and has bankrupt this country financially spiritually. it's not the governments place or responsibility to take care of your every need should you decide to be a highschool dropout, have children, have no self respect, no motivation, or wait til your dream job comes along. Pre welfare people turned to their community, church, family, friends and weren't above taking whatever jobs came their way to get back on their feet which in turn gave them motivation, encouragement, goals, humility, appreciation, confidence. Welfare is no longer what it's intended purpose was. it's encouraged people to be lazy, complacent, abuse the system, a way of life, lack of responsibility and self respect, puppets. God takes care of those who take care of themselves. We need to get back to what this country's people was founded on Pride, respect, goals, independence, hard work, unity, responsibility, accountability.",1

9,"People who qualify for welfare aren't using their brains. Not saying it would be easy, but if I were homeless, instead of wasting my life sitting on the road panhandling, I would WORK for my money. Now I know what you're thinking, ""Oh, you know how hard it is to get a job?"" Who said to get a real job? This is what I'd do: Go around door to door and introduce your situation and ask them if you could do any work for donations. Sure it doesn't sound like a lot, because it isn't, but their are good people out their and no one does things like this, they would expect you to just want handouts. So with that in mind, it's not unreasonable to think that you can't make a lot of money like this. Simple things like, ""Hi, I'm currently homeless and I'm looking to earn my share. Would you like me to take out your trash or have any work I can do for a donation?"" Think about how much more money you can get instead of waiting outside doing nothing. Welfare should only be for those who actually try to make a living and are just unfortunate. That is my opinion.",1

I have to pay an arm and a leg to afford college and have a career while the worthless leeches get to have everything for free. I'm sick of it. If you can't support yourself then it's just too bad for you. I hate when I see people paying with government assistance I just want to punch them. How about we start rewarding people who actually work and let the lazy and worthless starve; or else America will fall.,1
9,This would mean that we don't have to go to work. Welfare is making us work so hard for kids and ourselves and losing it for people who don't even work. Don't even feel bad for those pleading on the street because they are just lazy people who don't want to work like the rest of America.,1
9,"Charity should come from our hearts, not taken by force of the government. Private charities are much more efficient at distributing goods and services to the needy, and those charities are not, and should not be, publicly funded. Government welfare is a coercive and inefficient way of helping people in need. It also generates a sense of entitlement and creates cycles of poverty that can last generations. Government has no incentive to move people off welfare, because once it did that they would no longer be needed, they would have to find productive jobs themselves.",1
9,"I am all for helping the poor. We all have needed help along the way. For any who hold biblical ideals Jesus was pretty clear, we are meant to care for the poor. But no where in the scriptures did he say, ""The holy way to care for the poor is to have the Government force people to give up their money through taxation then have those funds run through slow inefficient bureaucracy till finally freely handed out to people who might need it where it ultimately encourages destructive habits."" An experiment don't by the Seattle Income Maintenance Foundation found that every 1 dollar subsidy given by the Government ended with 80 cent loss in labor by those individuals. We aren't doing them any favors by encouraging bad work ethics and laziness. Private charities historically are the most effect at alleviating poverty. We should look to the family, the church, the local community first to fix these problems where motivations are real and result based. Where people are close and understanding of the what the problem is and how to fix it. Government programs should be last place we go as they simply don't know what the local community knows about each given problem. But I will admit even this will not cure poverty. In the end to help the poor and needy we must create wealth. The only cure for poverty is the creation of wealth. And capitalism drives the creation of wealth. Encourage those principles is needy communities and have the rich come along side the poorer individuals and work to create wealth in those community is ultimately what will cure the poverty disease not Government programs that end up hurting those needy people.",1

Hell, they make more than me! If you need the help, by all means you should get the help! But generations of families being on the system is wrong. It needs to be updated, Monitored so it can't be abused! I know older people that could use the help and can't get it. And I know people that get it and do nothing at all and believe me they can, but like what is said. Why get a job when I can make more on welfare! Welfare queen is not a stereotype! it's a very true statement, I know it and you know it to! The system isn't being watched and the rest of us are paying for it! Right now there are more people collecting welfare then the number of people working full time. What would happen if the working class just gave up? What would happen then?

The house I work at has three men that live their and two pedifiles and their pedifiles that have messed up some poor kids lives and these guys have no boundaries and is supported by our government and tax dollars. This house alone pays around the ballpark of $200,000 a year in just the staffing hours which is 386 hours a week, for their very nice big house payment, and their food. That isn't including the miles they get to travel that is paid by the government or the companies profit and they make a nice profit.

It has been bred into them through our great welfare system over the past 40 years. More babies means more money, and if you complain enough someone will respond. Unfortunately there isn't enough jobs to support the current population in the United states because everyone is looking out for themselves and cheaper products means higher profits. I do know their is thousands of miles of highways that need to be cleared of litter. And thousands of state parks that could be pristine if we would just make people work for their monthly check.

This birth control can put a stop to those people that are having kids just to increase their checks from THE MAN. It may take some time, but once this catches on, how many men do you think will utilize this to not be tied to a crazy spouse. The benefits don't stop their. We will have far less children growing up in broken homes. Let me stop and say ""I am not against welfare"" i just believe the money should be used for legitimate needs IE. Vets, truly disabled, and SHORT term needs. I just did a count and found that of the 8 families that I know receive government. assistance, everyone is abusing it in some way shape or from. I get tired of them saying "" I could work, but then i would make less money overall and if i don't take the assistance someone else will"". This is literally the mindset of the majority.

Also, kids at school get free lunches if they're on welfare, then they go To the snack bar and buy iced tea and chips. If you can afford 2 dollars for that, you can afford normal lunch.

I do understand that their are people that could be helped by such programs and I have seen people that don't deserve such benefits. The augment that I see most people bring up is that they know someone whom would not be able to live without social security, Medicare, food stamps and so on. But as a nation and as individuals we cannot let personal feelings and thought cloud our judgment on over all policy and laws of our nation. We cannot afford the laws, programs and policies that are currently operating. I hear from most people that are in favor of said programs state that they would be functional if the government would abide by the rules and laws they have put in place. But the government I have grown up with has never been able to follow the rules or laws it sets for itself. So I feel that the programs in place will never be solvent. Even if they were I don't feel that they are helpful to the people and nation as a hole. We all know the history of the Roman republic/ empire in regards to their bread and circuses. I feel from what I have read to their history specifically to the capitals of rome it did not help the people as a hole. It made them more reliant on their government. For us the cost alone of such programs, which make up the vast majority of our federal budget when I personally don't see a founding in our constitution for anything close to what is in place as is. How as a nation and people can we be ok with the cost. I feel that the best assistance for people that may be destitute or otherwise impoverished come from family and community programs not from any state or federal programs.",1
9,"there are far too many people who abuse the welfare system. Welfare should not be a government entity in the first place. The problem is that welfare is paying out something like, on average, $18.00 an hour. More than twice what a minimum wage job can offer. For what? NOTHING. Those collecting welfare do nothing and make a decent life for themselves. Meanwhile those who earn their money have it taken from them. You can not ignore the fact that poverty is a problem but those in need should look to the Church or charity rather than the government. I think that perhaps looking to the government gives them less humiliation that the previously stated method. But in the case of the rich giving to church and charity and then eventually to the poor the poor can less likely abuse the system.

The more they take from taxpayers the less taxpayers have to support themselves and eventually they too end up in the welfare line. This puts more strain on the remaining taxpayers as tax increases cause more taxpayers to join the welfare line... And so on and so on. The system is out of balance and is no longer effective.

9,"Too many people have become slaves to the welfare system and don't realize it. They are so dependent on welfare programs, which causes lack of ambition. Furthermore, their needs to be a way to verify that welfare recipients are truly unable to find a job. I believe that there are million of people that do qualify for welfare; however, due to the million of people that leach on to the government, I think we lose sight of people who are truly in need.",1
9,"I know this family with seven kids who is getting welfare. She never worked, he's got some health issues. However, he can still work at some jobs. The kids are eating candies, chocolates and drink pop. Parents smoke at least two packs of cigarettes a day altogether. Mostly, kids eat at their grandma's house. At grandmas house, uncle who is 25 years old. works his butt off to pay for the bills. He can't afford to buy himself a pair of jeans once in half a year. Uncle supports his mother, grandpa and a younger sister who is in high school. He doesn't get any help from the government. However, the money he earns is not enough for so many people. I've seen many families like that who fake their disability and no income. My mother is making $2000 a month. $400 is taken from her check for the taxes + $218.00 is taken from her check for the insurance that covers 20-30% of her payments. She's diabetic, she has heart problems, high blood pressure, leg problem and she works without asking for help. The only thing she complains about is the taxes that are getting taken out of her paycheck. I think that government should hire people who will periodically be seeing those people that they give welfare to. More than 50% of people on welfare are healthy and working for cash. Yes, we need to help each other but we need to help to those who is in need of that help.",1
9,"Need to revamp system. All welfare to be terminated and new application to be started. Investigate fraud. Determine worth in providing funds. Identify the truly disadvantaged. their is too much fraud in the system. This tells all applicants that they just need to game the system and claim bigotry if their appeal is not upheld. Spend resources in rewarding productive behavior, Develop education path that does not include college. Identify students who would succeed in non academic jobs.",1
9,it's mostly the people with crafty minds who get benefits of any significance. The people who truly need it aren't getting it because of the same reasons they need it. Just like disability. Whatever stopped them from getting a job stops them from figuring out the welfare system. I've lived around plenty of people bragging about how much they get and make fun of me for working.,1
9,"Disability is not welfare. And obesity is not a disability. To be frank, if the government put 20% of what is spent on welfare into employment services, there would be no need for the other 80%. The government is lazy itself and that is as big of an issue as the people on welfare.",1
9,"The welfare system is being abused like crazy. Most people who are on the welfare system abuses it and never looks for a job. All you hear is excuses, I can't get a job cause this is a white man's country boo hoo. You keep having kids not because you want them, it's so u can abuse the welfare system more. I cant wait till the day it's cut off and you no good fake Americans half to leave this country to survive. The grand awaking in the USA is happening enjoy while you still can.",1
9,"Welfare was created to help people down on their luck, people who have worked and lost their job.Welfare was NOT created for lowlifes who choose it as a lifestyle or women who have multiple babies on welfare to get paid more! The statistics for abuse and neglect show 80% are mothers on welfare. The highest infant mortality are mothers on welfare! Welfare was not created to be a job, it was created for temporary use till you LOOK for a job and actually work!!! 68% of the people on welfare have NEVER held a job in their life and on 11% have attempted to hold a full time job??? They use tax money in which they have not given one red cent towards!! That is insane. I agree with a former poster, I see the abuse every day I go to work. They have fancy phones, fancy clothes, smoke like chimneys, get their hair weaves and nails, which I cant afford.... It is a choice to use welfare and not get a job,I am tired of paying dearly for their lazy choice. I say this for the majority, I do believe there are some out their who legitimately need to use welfare temporarily",1
9,"If I open up a lemonade stand that says free lemonade to anyone who's thirsty, a lot of people are going to all of a sudden become really thirsty. Requirements for welfare should at least become more strict to help people who really need it, like the disabled or elderly, and not the guy down the street too lazy to find a job who wants to have children, even though he can't afford to feed himself.",1
9,"When the government takes (via threat of imprisonment) bread that an individual worked all day to earn and gives it to another individual because they think that the other individual needs and/or deserves it more... That is called stealing. Truly needy people should be supported by their families and private charities. Frankly, our government has grown out of control and they have assumed a role they are neither qualified or have a right to perform. Government should be in the business of defending our borders and building our infrastructure. They should stay out of social problems altogether... America is overflowing with opportunity if one truly wants to engage and do well. Here are a few simple rules for success in America (I think you will find that those on welfare have violated most or all of them): Get a job (or two) and keep it. Live below your means. Pay CASH for everything - you pay 10 to 20% more by financing. Always buy used. Save. Put a significant portion of your gross income into a tax deferred retirement plan. don't have children you cannot afford. Maintain health and disability insurance. Sadly, many people ""accidentally"" have children they cannot afford. They finance a care they cannot afford. They finance or rent a home they cannot afford. They live a life they cannot afford... So when the jobs are scarce and the HUGE bills come due, they have no option but to stick their hand out for the safety net (because they know it is their). I work 2 jobs and make $60K a year, yet I live in a cheap efficiency (500 SF) and drive a used (paid for) care. I save 30% of my gross income and put 12% of my gross income into a 401K. Could I cut back on my savings and finance a bigger and ""better"" home and care? Of course, but I chose to make my money work for me... What we have here is a nation of unwise financial decisions that are being rewarded with a pat on the back and a ""awww it's ok"" ... Only when our countrymen are allowed to face the consequences of their own materialism and ""buy now pay later"" mentality will they learn the important lessons of saving and living below one's means.",1
9,"I agree with sugar sugar's point that welfare should be given in exchange for work per what the Bible says: 2 Thessalonians 3:10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. I support public healthcare and welfare systems, but I think it logical and moral that recipients should work for them. Those in need should be cared for by a moral government, but not given free handouts. it's a travesty so many people want to work.",1
9,"I have seen this so many times over my lifetime I can tell at first encounter with someone at their home if they are on welfare or not. In fact, two of my 3 neighbors are on some from of welfare. it's pretty obvious who works hard and takes care of their house, property and children and who are the welfare recipients, just by casual observance alone. The welfare recipients homes look like bombs went off in them and they are all torn up and in general disrepair. Both the welfare recipients are drug takers, prescription or otherwise, and one of them smokes pot and cigarettes and drinks. The children are unkempt, dirty and generally unruly brats who destroy every nice thing they may receive in no time and the non welfare folks are just the opposite.",1
9,"When I see people who receive aid from the government, playing angry birds on their iPhone, it just disgusts me. Don’t get me wrong, I understand that we as a nation should provide for those in need. We are one of the greatest nations ever, and as so, are in a position to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves. there are cases where the poorer people of society genuinely don't have a chance to work to make a living as others do, such as disabilities, or the inability to find enough of work to support one’s family. The problem is that many of those receiving aid at the bottom end are just fine with accepting money from the government, even if they have the opportunity to support themselves. This may stem from laziness, lack of caring, or the unwillingness to accept a job that they consider to be below their pay grade. When it comes down to it, it is this mentality, that they will willingly accept this aid, or even inveigle the government into giving them a labor-free payday, that generates such disgust within me. Welfare as we know it, needs to end. It is all too easy for somebody to sit around on their lazy butts, leeching off of society. Welfare is meant to help people who can't help themselves. Some on the receiving end need less government aid, and more of a change to their lifestyle.",1
9,"Welfare has had many benefits to the United States population but now people just see it as ""Dude! I just heard about this great program where I can quit my job and get paid to sit my lazy ass down on my couch and eat Cheetos!"" I understand that some people really do need it. But most of the time it's not completely true. By far is the money we pay into this program. Most people lose their jobs because of cuts and rely on this system. If we took Welfare out of the picture, we could pay of the United States Debt and put enough money back into the economy to create more jobs then we could ever use! We could fund advanced research on human anatomy and create cures for anything. All I can say is the benefits of destroying this program outweigh that of keeping it. I understand that it would bring harm to the families that lost their jobs and are too poor to afford anything but they won't complain in ten years when their making 40-50k a year because we could create enough jobs for everyone.",1
9,"We're tired of going hungry, we pay our bills every month, but by the time we're don't we have very little for food, but yet the lazy able bodied neighbor gets over 500 a month, our freezer and fridge are almost empty but theirs isn't, it isn't fair at all.",1
9,Everyone is born equal it is the education and work ethic that separates us. I think it's time everyone lived by their own choices if it means you starve it live on the street then that is what you have earned and deserve.As for the children well the sins of that her fall on the son. it's sad but they have no more right to eat then what you as a parent provide. All you are doing is teaching them to live off someone else. At the very least I think people on government programs shouldn't be allowed to vote or be ahead of working Americans in anything because they are a 2nd rate citizen. They don't help the country they mooch off of it. My family came from poverty and worked hard in the farm fields to raise my parents who worked in factories so that I could have the chance to do the same. If you want for your family it starts with you not what the government can give you. Do something with yourself to benefit humanity or die. Survival of the fittest except we let our weak and lazy survive. No one is entitled to anything in this work other than what your warm yourself.,1
9,"People abuse welfare when they are fully capable of supporting themselves. They may have more children, or refuse to get married just to stay on welfare. Also it's to varied from state to state which causes more people to migrate just to stay on it. It also brings in more immigrants.",1
9,"Welfare is wrong. People nowadays file for welfare and earn more than a minimum wage worker at McDonald's. PEOPLE IF YOU WANT MONEY WORK FOR IT.

How in the hell is that right, end this free crap and you would solve so so many problems in this country.",1
9,"Hand outs don't strengthen the country,hard work does. The same people using the welfare system are wearing $300 outfits. Quit enabling thugs and degenerates with my tax money. it's such a scam that you are drug tested to get a job but you are not drug tested to receive free money. Our forefathers would be ashamed. The government should have no hand in these matters,leave it to the local non profit agencies who can address unique problems in their surrounding areas.",1
9,Americans are paying their taxes for people who don't need welfare. We're handing it out like it's candy and it's sending the wrong message to the next generation. it's telling them that it's okay to not ever get a job because the government will take care of it for you. All you have to do is have kids and not married.,1
9,"Everyone should be encouraged to be independent and not rely on the handouts that come from the hard work of others.

Furthermore, they don't see the need to think for themselves when others are doing everything for them.",1
9,"It should be ended because it is being abused. How is it that I work 40 + days a week and have 0 in the bank once I pay my bills. I have people in my family that have been on welfare for over 18 years steady having children.

Please explain this.",1
9,"The government wants to make us get healthcare, why can't they force those on welfare to get jobs? Many of them could work, but the problem could be their lazy, on drugs, it's not worth it to work when they have to pay for child care for multiple kids. We could send the illegals home and put those on welfare to work in the fields picking crops, picking up trash, there has to be jobs somewhere for them, some could babysit while others work, instead of just sitting at home collecting other people's' tax money. Even disabled (maybe not all, but some) people could find some kind of work. their is such a thing as telecommuting. their are just too many for those of us working to keep supporting. Now they are going to raise our taxes with the healthcare law. Something's gotta give and it's coming soon.",1
9,"America has changed the course of history by being the first country in history based on the principles that every man owns their life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. It was intended to protect the individual over the collective. With those rights are right to property. To violate a person's right to property such as forcing Americans to pay for another's circumstances is a direct violation of this constitutional right. History has shown the destruction a country faces that is based in socialism has had. It opens the door to government tyranny such as North Korea, destructive livelihoods such was witnessed in Eastern Germany, china's farmlands and The old USSR. I don't know how much proof we need? Yet, Americans are taught ( this comes from the intellectual elite in prominent universities within major cities who ironically want a career in politics or government programs)that we are obligated to pay for the needy. That is a moral decision but not a constitutional right. To protect our Country we must stop the violation right to property . Therefore, those in need must rely on charity but they have no right to demand it from another. If they do, soon the producers will shrug and their will be no wealth to demand. Please turn of the Kardashians, pick up a history book and make your own conclusion.",1
9,"Something has to change. Welfare should only be for good responsible Americans who are down on their luck after working hard for years... If that. The con artists and the lazy need to be worked hard for less than minimum wage if they want a dime. Let's get some return on these individuals. Also, approval to have children and be eligible to receive any benefits in the future if something terrible happens. So before you have kids, you have to get approval to make sure you can afford them on your own or you're never eligible to get benefits. Period. If you can't afford them and don't meet approval, you're on your own. The hard working are sick of carrying you and raising your family. We want to keep the money we earn. An opt out policy would be nice as well. I'll never ask for welfare if I don't have to pay it. Same with social security Willing to sign off on that. Anyway just some random thoughts and ideas.",1
9,"When I see an obese family with 4 children on welfare in a McDonald's I know it has to be ended, the money is not theirs. My great grandpa was a coal miner with a black lung, and his son (my grandpa) became a captain. They worked up, they lived the AMERICAN DREAM that so many other people back then in this beautiful country worked themselves to death for, they dreamed about a bright future for their children, that their children would do better then them. These were the men and women who got this country to it's golden age. But now it is dying since we turned into a welfare country. Our ancestors would turn around in their graves if they would hear about this filth.",1

As for the other lowlifes who sit on their asses for 30 days staring at the calendar for the next handout so that they can go and buy jewelry or other useless materialistic items make me sick. Their selfish behavior affects people like myself who wake up every single morning and sit at that desk from 9-5 it’s called being an adult and earning a living. And I'm sorry but ""there's NO JOBS"" is an excuse lazy people USE to avoid judgment, I've seen people at rock bottom get up and get any job handed to them and I'm talking down to McDonald's working hard EARNING a check.

9,A man in Kentucky owns a mining company. His company is understaffed. He can not hire from the community. He can not expand his business. Because applicants cannot pass a drug test. Community members rather stay at home and collect welfare. Unemployment in this area is over seventy percent. The children inherit this lifestyle and find it ordinary. It becomes a generational curse. Break the cycle.,1
9,"Endless amounts of unchecked welfare and entitlement programs without an ounce of accountability or personal responsibility are sinking this country and society in general. Not enough people are talking about it and politicians avoid the topic. As someone who has worked several years in Social Services and Community Service, I can tell you that the system is severely broken and abused. Yes there are people who really need and appreciate the help as they struggle through various life situations. But. their is an enormous and growing. Population of individuals in this country who are cheating and abusing the system because. They don't want to work And because the current system allows them to do so. Imagine being paid to sit on your fat ass all day and do nothing. Knowing that the US Government and all the working ""suckers"" will support you. Millions of people go through life each day taking from others. They offer little or nothing to society and mankind. They take. These folks don't even have to volunteer to earn their benefits. They get it FOR FREE! What's worse? They wear it like a badge and are unapologetic. So you end up with a country where only half the people are paying taxes while the other half pay nothing. They take. The tax paying half are forced to work and pay ever increasing taxes for the population who is able to manipulate the system. And avoid hard work and responsibility. The reason why politicians don't address this massive problem? They understand they are guaranteed a career in politics if they continue to hand out free stuff without an ounce of accountability or personal responsibility. All a liberal Democrat has to do is deal the drugs And let's be honest. Free stuff to the lazy is the new crack, heroin or cocaine and the politicians are the dealers. The abusers will line up en masse at the polls come election time so the free stuff can keep coming. Responsible people in politics. The minority Have no chance to be elected to office. The rest of us who went to school, developed careers and worked hard like we were taught to do many years ago...Are screwed. there's nothing that can be don't. This is the new United States and that is embarrassing. Our parents and grandparents are rolling over in their graves.",1
9,"People on welfare are just lazy. We are giving out money to people who don't work for it, and honestly don't deserve it. It sucks for the hard working Americans that have to give up hard earned money to people that do nothing. The more kids they have, the more money they get. Does that sound right? More people on welfare just cheat the system and end up more well off than your average American and that is completely backwards. I don't believe in welfare and think the people on it without jobs are lazy. The US was built from hard workers which these people are not, and it's making everybody in the US look lazy, what happened to us? Welfare should not be around to be cheated anymore.",1
9,I believe that there's people who do need help and I understand that but we have way too many lazy people sitting around overusing the system sitting home watching TV smoking their cigarettes and drinking the beer that we are buying them and I'm sick of it.

Welfare does absolutely nothing to encourage people to go out and get a job and want to support themselves. it's bull!,1

I understand that some people get it hard at some point in their life and genuinely need the assistance, but 6 months should be the max.

If you force people to work to survive I guarantee that they will work...And those of you that say that the crime rate would go up...That is why we have gun licenses.",1
9,"I'm actually doing a paper on this at the moment, and I would have to say yes, that we need to get rid of welfare. Either that or make some extreme changes to who qualifies for it. I'm still in high school and I'm perfectly aware of our nation's huge debt. I have the national debt clock in live time up right now, and let me tell you, their is a lot of red and a lot of numbers. Plus it's constantly increasing. And the only way we'd be able to fix the economy would be to actually *GASP* pass a few laws. Such as this one in particular. The reason that this is such a hot button right now is because the constitution clearly states that as citizens of the United States of America, we have the right to the pursuit of happiness. And your average poor person probably isn't happy. But you have to remember that the idea of welfare started during the Great Depression Era. That was a while ago. While our economy still isn't that great, times have changed. Back then people stood in breadlines, wire feed sack dresses so threadbare you could see through them, and lived in hoovervilles. Can't say I've seen any people wearing feed sacks lately. Maybe it's time to reconsider some things. Public works was also started during the Great Depression, and I think it would be a good idea to start doing more of that. At least the people saying ""no"" would be able to have that to back them up. Plus they could feel good about themselves because they'd be helping society. We need to keep our roads in better condition. I'm tired of potholes. Also, judging by other people's ""yes"" comments, welfare is making the middle class hate the poor when we're supposed to pity them. On the matter of whether or not people deserve welfare, I know families that deserve it. Yet I also know a family on it who has four children and both parents smoke. See their I go, I don't want to have to hate the poor. Someone mentioned disabilities too. My dad is legally disabled, and disability checks are actually a completely separate matter; they're not what's being debated right now. Mostly because anyone who hates on a person in a wheelchair may find the wheelchair being thrown at them. You just can't hate on people with disabilities, period.",1
9,"I can't stand it. We are paying for lazy people who are watching TV and playing Xbox. I'm sorry for my behavior to the people who need welfare, I don't mean you. I think before the Government hands out more, they should do more background checks to make it fair.",1

But then I have a cousin in OK that has 6 kids different baby daddies never married. She so lives on the system plus she gets extra money because her kids have disorders. She has no intentions to better herself even though they offered to help her. Then she even came up with the idea of homeschooling her kids. Granted she never even finished high school. She's just doing this so she doesn't have to get up and get her kids to school. I just hope her kids are not the same way. But a lot of times they follow their parents footsteps. If she had to pay for her kids believe me she wouldn't be having them.,1

I can't believe that it has come to a point in our society where we allow those on welfare who are burdening our society to shame the honest, good and hard working Americans that support this country.

9,"It is a shame that so many hard working Americans such as myself have been diagnosed with autoimmune diseases and cancers that are of no actions of our own. I have scleroderma lung disease and must continue to work even while taking the chemo and other meds, because there's nothing out there for me. I am even vested in the Social Security system and can not touch a cent to help with medical bills. I am a verteren of two tours in Iraq and know my issues are directly related to the vaccines, but of course the DOD and VA will not take any responsibility. My main reason for posting here and venting is that I am tired of drug addicts, alcoholics, anyone who can't keep pants up and legs closed, and anybody who just refuses to work is classified as poor and in need of help. When are we as a nation going to hold people responsible for their own actions. I will never see a cent of my SSI money, but I'm sure the dozen or so addicts will enjoy spending my hard earned money.",1
9,"By knowing the people around me, free money doesn't seem to help anybody. People on welfare are lacking the application and they seem to lose the interest for looking for job. If they are getting welfare, they should do work for government for money. For example, the government can have them clean the parks, (because we are cutting those services for budget cut) and they get paid based on that time. They can do that their off hours. Perhaps that would help motivate them to find a better job - maybe send them to school and so on.",1
9,"Again, People have found a way to mess it all up. What a great concept to have the Government help those people truly in ""need"" - To have the more fortunate subsidize ""temporarily"" for those less-fortunate. But ....WE THE PEOPLE have found a way to LIVE off of this help! NO MORE WELFARE AFTER ONE YEAR. ALL WELFARE RECIPIENTS MUST DRUG TEST EVERY THREE MONTHS AND BE NEGATIVE FOR ALCOHOL OR DRUGS, IF NOT THE WELFARE IS GONE (FOREVER) - PEOPLE ARE WELFARE CANNOT HAVE ANY MORE CHILDREN, IF SO THAT CHILD WILL NOT BE COVERED BY WELFARE - ONE YEAR AND THAT'S IT....THEN YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN -",1
9,"The current from of welfare is a sad sight. People abuse it or misuse the money and it ends up being a burden on the people who don't use it and don't need it. And even for those who do use it, it doesn't help them get a better job so they can sustain themselves. Welfare should be changed so instead of handing out money, they could receive job training, or if they're a few credits away from a degree, waive the rest of their college fees. But these handouts have got to stop.",1
9,"The majority of people on welfare are able to work. They continue to have more and more children..When hard working responsible people won't have more kids because they can't afford it because 1/3 of their paycheck goes to generational welfare families who abuse the system...And we are cutting air traffic controllers because of the deficit, taking jobs away from hard working people and putting the public's safety at risk... CUT welfare NOT jobs from hard working people! Welfare recipients should be required to show proof of job seeking. In addition, they should not be REWARDED by having more and more children with a bigger welfare check. They are bankrupting America and taking away services from those who truly need it.",1
9,"We don't need it. A society has grown that even with free education, refuses to participate and instead, finds a way to underachieve enough to get a hand out. We don't want you to be alive anymore. Just toss yourself over a cliff or something. Your children will now have hit the SS jackpot with the death of a parent- now the rest of your deadbeat family will be FIGHTING over who gets the baby with the BIG check attached. If you really want to throw up- check out the amount of money a family gets for SS when one parent dies. 3 years widow benefits, at about 1150.00 per month, even if they are divorced. Each kid, 1150 per month until they are 19 or graduate from HS. Oddly enough, the majority drag out HS and don't graduate on time! Wow what a surprise. A single parent now gets 3, 450.00 IN CASH per month with 2 kids. Now, this scale should be set to ONLY what the widow or widower would get in CHILD SUPPORT, not a huge lifestyle change. I could tell you the sickness of a family I know that has lived off this system for 3 generations- they feel entitled to Welfare checks, are low achievers and have had many drug and alcohol issues. After the SS jackpot hits, the remaining parent always can't hold a job anymore! One family- generation 3 of this, is suspected of burning down the trailer the father was living in to get SS checks. End this crap now. Do the child support match and pay only that. Most kids in the world and America don't have 2 participating parents. The death of one is no worse then the children deserted by one parent which is most of the population.",1
9,"I don't have children as I could not afford them. I don't want to pay for yours or you. Cut it all off and stack up the bodies as people think they will DIE unless someone else pays their way. News flash, they won't die- they will take that minimum wage job that I did myself for over 14 years to get out and they will feed themselves and figure it out. Yes, the transition will suck, for all of us. But it is WELL worth it.",1
9,Way too much fraud in Welfare. If the Government can consider playing with Social Security which retirees have paid for over what they can ever receive I don't believe all this free money should be given out to people who can work and are able bodied. This is not Government money this is your money and mine. The folks paying for this are the hard working individuals that are being told that they will not receive Social Security at all after paying into this system. The Government has taken enough money from hard working folks and squandered it. Our Government is way to large and involved way to much. They the so called Government workers forget that we the people are the Government.,1
9,"I see whole families being raised this way. The kids of these people think this is owed to them as a way of life, while hard working people struggle. Cities and states lay off teachers--take some of these people off of this that can and should be supporting themselves.",1
9,"I feel like there's other things we can do besides welfare that will actually help other honest, hard working people out besides the people who try to scam off of it for free. If we do still have welfare then I think it needs to be heavily revised, I only say yes not because I think the welfare system needs to be gone, but I think it needs to be changed... Dramatically. I think maybe people need to think of a better system so people can't take advantage of it's benefits, I do believe this is very hard but not entirely impossible either. I am only saying yes because it seems to have become completely unavailable to the people who actually need it. I think in a way we need it but only to those who are in dire need of it, but not to people who have kids but no disabilities, they are perfectly healthy and work for a living, granted there's some people who still need help but it gets to the point that the system awards us for bad behavior, it's learned behaviors pretty much, and that I don't condone by any means. I feel like if the welfare system was revised and changed a little bit, it would force people to look at their own actions and be more responsible. Today I don't think their is enough people who have good morals or responsibility and that is the most important thing about a society.",1
9,"I know way too many people in my town living everyday off of welfare. I work on the road too and hear a bunch of people wanting to move to Michigan because it's easier to get welfare. Give assistance to single mothers, disabled people, that class needs it, but junkies, lazy people and alcoholics need to be cut off. All we're doing is supporting their bad habits and getting ourselves cut short on pay checks. I love my country and am more then willing to do my part but all the corruption and loopholes that let people take advantage of my hard earned money needs to end.",1
9,"their are people who are lazy and haven't worked a day in their life but are making more money then the people who have worked ever since they were able to because of welfare! their are people who have welfare and just don't need it, but they're too lazy to do anything else and it's just too easy to make more money than a regular worker that way. Then there are people who actually need welfare, but can't get it! My 72 year old grandfather still works, but recently he had a small heart attack. He only gets 6-8 weeks of unemployment compensation... their are people who are on it because they are so fat that they are actually classified with having a disability. it's a disgrace and a waste of money! it's also a prime factor in America's weight rating and debt rating. Because how easy is it to sit back and do nothing at all and still make more money then the average worker? As easy as welfare.",1
9,"As a family I am the working dad. My wife works as a kitchen help at school part time. We make no more than 50k a year. We shop thrifty and a steak or lobster or even shrimp dinner is rare! I work in retail and what I see are welfare EBT. Card people living like kings eating what my family might have when we are all caught up with bills every week. Things high priced and not healthy fill their cart! I am all for helping the people who need it, but when they are buying cases of Pepsi, chips, chicken wings, etc. Come on! Now I""m going to have to pay for your health care! More and more people are seeing this. Lets make a stand! Convict Obama of treason!",1
9,"I believe that most of our welfare system needs to go. The first change, which I believe should be implemented immediately, is limiting how many children will be provided for and now allowing women, or men, to have more children while on welfare. If they choose to disregard this rule, then no benefits for the child conceived while on welfare. This sounds cruel but it is necessary. I know many women that have rarely worked and always used public assistance with 3+ children. It is ridiculous and needs to stop now. If a person newly signing up for public benefits already has children they should not have more until they can fully support them and if the person has no children, well then they shouldn't until they can pay for the child without help. These changes will cause a lot of grief at first but will make the entire situation better eventually. I believe welfare in all of it's forms is overused and abused but I also know that there are many jobs out their that don't pay enough to raise a family with any quality of life. I believe that workers rights and wages should be increased while at the same time weaning the population off of government assistance. I firmly believe that people who can't support children without help should have not them and no matter how cruel it is, that assistance should be stopped. It will be a rough transition but people will learn.",1
9,Welfare should be reviewed twice a year and benefits cut back if people are well enough to work. To many people abuse it and welfare breeds welfare generation after generation and it makes me sick. I am 48 years old and I see people from 17 up on it! Why? They are all capable of working and don't.,1
9,"Welfare should be allowed for only a finite amount of time. Let's say a year for the sake of debate. If you can't get your act together in a year then the problem should be nobody's but your own. It should be a one time deal, and you only get what you have put into the system. I have a responsibility to my family not to yours. The benefits should not be a credit card that you can use nearly anywhere either. You should get a box of rations that provides all the nutrition your family needs.",1
9,"People take advantage of welfare. They act like they can't find a job or don't strive to earn more. When my sister was born my mom got WIC but she was upset to see women with iphones, manicures, had their hair don't and had gotten out of nice cars asking for money?! We are hard working people, everything we have we have worked to get. Why are our taxes supporting people that don't wish to work? Maybe some help may be good but in small quantities. They get food stamps they also get cash and everything they need. My aunt used to use the money to buy drugs and that is when I was upset. That means she didn't need it. Perhaps if we didn't give so much then people would be forced to be more responsible! As I recall welfare was created during the Great Depression, that was long ago. it's time for people to be responsible and focus on helping ourselves!",1

9,"As a young professional working a 40 hour work week and losing 30% of my wages to taxes, I am furious with the welfare system of the US. Not only do we provide more money to poor people who often times are VERY capable to work, but we offer incentives for them NOT to marry and to have LOTS of children because they get more money this way. So not only are we feeding their lack of work, but we are supporting their reproduction to create even more lazy, non working Americans. The average family on welfare makes more by sitting on their butts all day then they would working a minimum wage job - SOMETHING IS WRONG HERE! Why are we paying people more to do nothing, then we are to those who are trying to support themselves. Teenage girls are dropping out of high school to have 1, 2, 3 or more babies just to get a monthly check. And their debts magically vanish when they default - so let me regroup: by borrowing and taking free handouts, then not having enough to pay it back, my debt disappears???? BOGUS. Having put myself through college and am now fully supporting myself, I understand what it means to work hard and EARN money. Now that this Nation is left supporting the lazy people, and treating them like royalty with free food, free housing, and free health care they will NEVER start working again unless welfare is either STRICTLY reformed or abolished. Our nation is now in a new from of slavery - middle class slavery - and it should be abolished by lowering taxes and getting lazy people off their butts and into jobs.",1

Those that can't take care of themselves will sink the whole ship. Nature abandons their week offspring, so they will not lose the entire family. The same should be don't with human beings. Women and men that make bad choices continue to bring offspring and expect others to make up for their poor decisions. I'm poor and manage to make it on my low income. I refuse to have government assistance, because I have pride, work hard, and manage my money. If I could do this so can every other dead beat that I am presently supporting on a very low income.

Honestly it's time to end welfare our country is becoming TO LAZY!,1
9,"Welfare as a concept is a fairly good idea, but when it is put into practice , it succumbs to human greed and laziness. Too many people abuse the system to get money for nothing.

They need jobs and education, or else they should be in jail or institutionalized. I don't want to support them or their intentions anymore. Stop ruining my life for the benefit of theirs.

9,Welfare should be abolished. What happened to the American Dream. I was taught that if you wanted a nice house and a good school for your children you worked hard to obtain those things. I was also brought up to believe that you don't get anything for free. I know in Philadelphia people on welfare do almost better than I do. I could make a nice living but so much of my money goes to support programs for people who don't feel like working. Believe me I worked in a welfare office and most people were very able bodied. I had cancer and paid all my bills while half of the people that were receiving chemo were on welfare. I was told that my insurance would not cover a shot that I needed to stay alive. I had to find a way to pay for it and I did - every penny. While the people on welfare did not even have to worry about a bill. What is fair about that? I worked since I was 14. I worked hard and put in a lot of overtime. I had to sell my care. Plus all the while I had to work no matter what I felt like as long as I could stand up. Meanwhile the money that is taken from my pay for those people sitting next to me who don't work would have been a great help to me. People have to be responsible for themselves. This nation is going downhill very fast and it is sad to watch.,1

Not only are some of our citizens lazy, they play the Welfare system. As shocking as it may sound, people actually brag about how much money they are making sitting on their butt. it's come to the point where you can make more money on Welfare than you can at a minimum wage job, which is one initial issue.

Help with budget costs at all levels across the country 3. Allow their children to see them making a contribution.,1
9,"My town, like so many in Minnesota, has become a depressing, numbing place with very little sense of community, despite the efforts of our mayor. Democrats run our state. They have an endless list of social programs that we are taxed to pay for. Word spreads fast and we have created in our own population and attracted huge numbers of people who are basically ""takers"". That is their lifestyle. They are often uneducated, shockingly uneducated. They are often violent. Our city will never be the same. We pay more to educate and feed their children, to police their violence, to provide housing, to provide medical care, etc. I would rather live in the middle of nowhere with good, hardworking people who care for one another personally, then live among the welfare crowd and the liberal officials who dispense these drugs. It is numbing to have ill feelings toward others; to see the decay of character in our people. Without community, America has no meaning.",1

I can't count how many people I have seen at the gas station buying pop and chips with food stamps and then buying cigarettes and beer in a separate transaction.

Of course, if we also abolished the minimum wage and deported 11 million immigrants we would also reach full employment in this country. So there's that.",1

In other words take the money from people who ""earn"" it and give it to those who think they are ""entitled"" to it. This is just one of the many problems with this country that will eventually lead to its demise. People who collect welfare or any sort of governmental aid should have their expenses strictly monitored and if it's being spent on anything other then necessities it should be eliminated for that person/family immediately. People on welfare should not be living a quality lifestyle by any means. If you want a quality lifestyle perhaps make yourself useful and get a job and do something with yourself",1
9,This is important to end because it is not helping our financial state as a country. Many don't understand why I am against this but truly it's because I am a hard working American citizen and the thought of my hard earned money going to someone who doesn't deserve it is gut wrenching. I do feel that welfare is a good system but it has come to where so many abuse the system that it is very controversial.,1
9,"Those who receive welfare don't try to better themselves by going to school or finding a job, they just continue having more children that they cannot afford because they know the government will take of them; the more children you have, the more help you have. For example, you will get more 'food stamps' based on your number of children, more welfare, more help. Their children are also covered under medicaid for health insurance with taxpayers money. Someone has to pay for all of this! I am a hard working responsible young woman who knows I am not financial ready to bring children into this world, but I have no medicaid because I have no children; therefore, I have to pay out of pocket my birth control costs so our hard working taxpayers don't have to raise my children. Does this make any sense? The government caters to the poor and crap on the people who work hard and TRY to make a living. Maybe I should sit on my butt and pop a baby out every year; then I'd have food stamps, health insurance, welfare, section 8 to pay my housing rent, etc. What a shame this country is, or has become. Everything is backwards. Cut all welfare and other programs who help these people, it will force them to find a job and contribute to society instead of constantly taking. Btw, Im American born and raised, seeing what this country has evolved into, Im saving every hard earned penny made in the United States And moving myself up north to Canada! The new 'american' dream is getting the hell out of here!",1

9,"The first law of economics states that people respond to incentives. Now, to offer free money is to offer the incentive to take that free money, in order to receive such money, one must be unemployed, this means that some section of the population will disregard the social pressure and chance to earn a higher wage, and live in government housing, living of government welfare. By eliminating welfare, we create an incentive to work. We drive the economy, and we can then lower tax money, allowing people to spend, thus driving the economy.",1
9,"For the most part, Welfare should be ended. It takes tax dollars from the those productive citizens and gives it to those who have failed at life. I still have not met a single person that can give me an answer to this very important question. Why should my taxpayer dollars go to pay for someone else's living expenses? I don't expect them to pay for me, so they should not expect me to pay for them. Let's sit down after I get my paycheck and line all the people on welfare up. I will then allow each of them to tell me how much of my check belongs to them and why. If I hear a good response, I might give them something, but until then, welfare is failing and it is truly immoral. And before you start thinking, ""Oh my, this guy is so greedy"" I will remind you that my paycheck is all MY money that I have EARNED through hard work.

Over my 34 working years I remember placing $300 plus of groceries in the trunk of a full size Cadillac whose owner shopped weekly and paid for in paper Food Stamps/late 1970's. I apprehended folks stealing merchandise and alcohol and baby formula from my retail stores that I managed to trade for drugs. I spoke with the captain of the local police dept.

9,This idea was obviously the worse mistake America has made. People are taking advantage of this and it is getting out of hand. If you NEED welfare then that is one thing.

My dad is the manager of a Publix and he constantly has people coming into his store to use food stamps and stuff like that but they use these food stamps to buy stuff like lobster and they also are walking around using like the top notch phone, such as the iphone 5 or samsung galaxy s4. it's also aggravating that they will give their friends their food stamps and let them use it. I understand that some people actually need it but if you actually need it why take advantage of it? That defeats the purpose of it and makes the people that are actually paying for everything even if they are struggling really mad and irritated.",1

Just work for the city essentially. I am sick of working 63 hours a week at one job. Making over minimum wage.

I choose to save money for an emergency while also holding insurance policies, I choose to be 30 and postpone childbearing until my financial situation is more predictable, I choose to do yard work to keep my property value high, and I choose to stay in a job I dislike for the security. Why should I be forced to pay for people who choose not to do these things and thereby delay or cause detrimental harm to goals and desires I have planned for myself and my family? If teen/poor families were forced to rely on private charitable donations the rates of repeat offenders would decrease and other teens/poor families would be more likely to see what it truly means to survive through bad choices. If we continue on this pattern we will either end up imploding under communism, revolution, or the absolute destruction of society.",1
9,"I'm a Democrat myself first of all, however, one major thing I very much disagree with my party is the welfare system. I believe that it is a major waste of our tax money (just like military) and it is over spent for, from the hard working middle and working class who have to work to supply this money. I believe we should raise the minimum wage enough so the people can support their life needs without any assistance from the government which ultimately comes from the working people. Those on welfare are capable of working and shouldn't be living off the backs of the people that are actually doing the work.",1
9,"Welfare was never intended as a career option. People sit at home have kids while the rest of us neglect our kids because we have to work longer hours to provide for these people? I think not! Welfare and Section 8 has become too socially acceptable and needs to be eliminated or at least re-analyzed. Our society needs to stop counting on this as a safety net and thus force to work hard. We are losing our American spirit people, Americans are hungry and strong so let's stop crippling our neighbors!",1
9,"People are getting lazy or conforming with government benefits instead of making efforts to work and educate themselves. The people that are working are paying major taxes and paying for these people's expenses that really are making no effort to get a job. it's totally unfair. Also many are committing social security fraud, it's time the government works harder at getting people to work instead of paying them to cheat the system or staying home being lazy.",1
9,"I worked my ass off to get where I'm at today and I don't like giving MY money away to people who think they can buy soda and steaks with it, at least only allow them bread water and ground beef and let em be damn happy with that, they should be luck they live in a country where they even have running water....",1
9,"Federal, state, and city governments should be designed to provide an infrastructure for its citizens. Bridges, roads, police, court systems, parks, and water services are several core examples. With that said, their are examples of traditional services that are better suited to non-governmental agencies. Energy, fire protection, and school services can be more effective by private parties. Taking money from one taxpayer, and giving it to another based solely on need is not a proper function of government. When taxpayer money does not go to a benefit for all citizens (IE. A public park), that is social redistribution. It is irresponsible for two people to have children that cannot afford to do so. A welfare state promotes irresponsible behavior. It is a fundamental right to have children, however it is not a fundamental right to have someone else pay for them.",1
9,"In life, personnel and professional goals are only achieved when deadlines are applied to goals. Welfare has no goal set to get people off of it. The design is the opposite, it encourages people to stay on it and grow ever more dependant on it. Once you go on welfare their needs to be a timeline that starts ticking to a set point that it ends. During that time period you need to have points along the way that check to see what you are doing to get off the welfare. their also needs to be screening for the use of illegal substances in order to receive a welfare check. their also needs to be a limit as to how many times in your life you can go onto welfare. If you can't find work in the private sector that creates wealth then you are assigned a government or social service type job for a percentage that is lower than private sector industry jobs of equivalent nature. Society takes care of itself by working and rewarding effort not rewarding lazy and destructive behavior.",1
9,"Don't give them anything. No food, no home, no medical, nothing! The minimum wage should also be removed. If they can't afford to eat, let them die or eat off garbage dumps, just the way it is don't in many parts of Asia their should also be a law against begging on the streets as well where they are put into forced labour camps and have to work for food to survive.",1
9,"Welfare induces laziness in the lower class of America. The mindset of the lower class is ""I can either sit on my butt and get money for free from the government or go work at the local mcdonalds for eight hours in a day and earn a little more then i would be getting from a welfare check"". We need to end this mindset",1
9,"I work everyday of my life 60 hours a week. I have two bad knees. The left one has been replaced two times. I am now waiting to have the right one replaced. I injured my right knee in 2011 at work. It has taken until August 1st 2013 to get a ruling from a judge to get it fixed. My surgery is October 8th 2013. My wages will not be the same. If I was on welfare my knee and everything else that was wrong with me would be taken care of. My brother and niece would have had it don't in two weeks, no questions asked. They also would still get their food stamps and cash assistance and free phone.",1
9,"Welfare is a good idea in theory, you help the needy and desperate to climb out of their financial hole, unfortunately in today's world, welfare has become more about supporting those, who while perfectly able to work and make ends meet, choose to live a life of ease and luxury at the expense of those who do the hard work. And with this enormous amount of undesired bloat, more and more families have realized, there is no real incentive to work for what can be had for free, at least free in their own minds. Those who wake up everyday and go to work, busting their rear ends, for low pay, no benefits, no overtime, and an increasingly hostile work environment, are not seeing the payoff. Instead they see a mass of under educated, lazy, nonchalant welfare leeches, who often have all the luxuries associated with hard work, things like nice cars, free smartphones, free clothing, and top shelf groceries, I've literally seen it with my own eyes, several of these types at the store with two shopping carts loaded to the brim with the best cuts of meat, and organic produce. The bottom line, welfare is out of control, and until this country implements a system where hard work truly leads to success, the growing number of people sucking the life blood of this country, the working class, will continue to grow until it can no longer sustain its own weight and collapses in on itself, leaving another ill afforded crisis in its wake.",1
9,"it's a crutch used by worthless criminals pretending to be parents never trying to get out of the welfare state, yet continue to have more kids, demand more money because of the increase of children in their house! it's a shame it needs to come to this but too many frauds have tainted a once helpful system.",1
9,"The biggest mistake the government made was not getting rid of welfare in the first place. there are too many people on it, popping out kids that they couldn't afford otherwise, now yours and my tax dollars have to pay for their good times. Is it my fault that these people are poor? No, since when does the human race owe each other anything? Half the time they don't even look after their kids properly. I also think these welfare people should be sterilized. Look at how many of these kids are in foster care? This government is stupid for not getting rid of welfare.",1
9,"I agree that their are people out their that do need a hand due to adverse situations. But as a citizen who has worked and paid taxes for 3 decades the inequity between working Americans and welfare recipients is sickening. If I decide to have another child my employer does not pay me extra. I have to be able to afford it on my salary. I have known working people that have lost property or gone bankrupt due to medical bills. This is never a factor to welfare recipients. Each person, whether they ever need to use them, should have a specified period of time and amount of benefits that they can receive over their lifetime. Once those are exhausted you are responsible for yourself and your offspring. This would put a sense of responsibility and allow people to choose when and how to use those benefits. In short their should be some responsibility placed on the individual as opposed to lack of personal responsibility that the system allows at the present time. Persons who need long term assistance due to disabilities or medical conditions should fall under their own program.",1
9,"Our government is on a warpath against hard working American Citizens, military DOD employees and retired military to cut spending when in fact they should be cutting spending from those who are getting free benefits! Hard working Americans should be sick and tired of lining the pockets of lazy people and drug dealers! Welfare people don't marry to keep their benefits, they have multiple babies with multiple unknown fathers to keep the money rolling in each month. Then to top it off the majority of apartment buildings across the USA take section 8/vouchers junking up anywhere ""decent"" to live. In addition the majority of welfare women in my personal apartment living experience have their male counterpart living with them in hiding! I'm sick of handing out money hand over fist while my retired navy husband gets his benefits cut and threatened!",1
9,"No support from me started work at twenty stopped at eighty two. If no jobs are open should attend community training program. Do community service, stop bad habits, don't use drugs, don't associate with thugs and others who would like to drag one down and in the next general election vote for all the conservative candidates on the ticket.",1
9,"No accountability no responsibility- the government to my knowledge has not got a plan in place to check out the welfare cases that have 1 to 10 kids, shack up, and have no intentions of a different life. But the working person is paying the price. The bible says you don't work you don't eat. Government is saying you don't work you get rewarded. Man up government /house/senate/ american people desire this right.",1
9,"In general, welfare is counter-productive. In general, welfare recipients have no motivation to better themselves, which is compounded by free handouts and no social programs (vocational), to enable people to take personal responsibility, and balance these programs. Democrats encourage welfare, and amnesty for future, social leeches. Close to 100 million Americans and illegals, partake in some sort of social program, besides medicare and social security. Who do you think these people vote for? Our country is turning more socialistic with every Democrat president. Welfare is a broken system that needs to be phased out. To finish this off, no matter Democrat or Republican, these politicians are not looking out for the people's best interests.",1
9,"I personally know several that get Food Stamps and don't need them. I also know for a fact that several of these actually sell their Stamps for 50 cents on the dollar. I have expressed my opinion to them and told them they should be arrested along with the person who buys them. They are both stealing. I know their are some that need help, so a new program needs to be started so these people can apply and get qualified for help.",1
9,It should be earned. Giving away trillions in free handouts is absurd. If your 65 or older or you are disabled severely or have served in the military then you deserve it. Free handouts lead to an incapacitated society and fixes nothing. It creates unnecessary debt for this country.,1
9,"This is the mentality many people on welfare have. If someone is working hard for them to be able to eat then they should enjoy all the free money they are given! Welfare is becoming a handicap for many people, it is causing laziness. Now am I saying all people on welfare are taking advantage of the program? No, but many are. You can argue that an insignificant amount of money is taken out of our paychecks, but it doesn't matter if one cent is taken out, none of my money should go to ""help"" a family that is not trying to help themselves!",1
9,"Yes this should all come to an end! I work at a low income property, 100% section 8. I have only been here for a short time and have learned more then I would like to know about how people cheat the system on a daily basis. More than half of a property that is not working and HUD picks up the tab, hah! Some rents as low as $25 a month! WHAT?!?! Thousands of dollars a month go into paying for just the rents, not including the collection of food stamps, cash assistance, disability, and unemployment. It is insane how much the government goes after the people who DO work out here as opposed to the ones that don't. And then their is the class out here that are known as ""lifers"" a fancy little word that refers to the ones who not only live off of government and taxpayers money, but then teach their children to do the same and their children after them! 3 Generations! Nobody is that bad off to do it for that long and if ending the assistance would do away with the injustice of me having to pay for this group then so be it! I am a single mother of 1 child and have never received welfare and also at one point had to work 6 jobs to make sure me and my son were taken care of. If I can do it anyone can. My family does not come from money and I have to live paycheck to paycheck, but I was instilled with work ethic unlike so much of my generation! Something must be don't.",1
9,"The argument really revolves around who should be responsible for helping those that ""NEED"" as in can't work any job (A small percent of the population or else most of our country would be so disabled that they couldn't work any job in America). Should it be the government who always uses force to take money from some people and give it to others (Socialism like in other countries that failed) or other destructive means like inflation, borrowing money from other countries ""WE"" can't pay back( thereby raising the national debt) or private charity helping the few that can't work like the red cross or the churches which is booed to the ground because apparently 99% of the country is to greedy to do that. Whats sad is they are probably right now that we use socialism.",1
9,"It is not being used right, people are living off it, it needs to be temporary, use all the money you'll save to create more government jobs. Police, fire, teachers, etc. People are abusing the system, sitting on their butts, not doing anything but drugs and having kids, while the rest of us work our butts off and have 1/4 of our income taken away and given to the government which in turn is given to these lazy losers. there should be a max amount you can withdraw and you once you use it it's gone, no extensions or anything. And If they need to get assistance again they can only use how ever much they have paid in. If they can't find a job put them in the military as a janitor, or logging community service hours. Every week they are on welfare they need to wear a certain color shirt and put in 40 hours a week of community service, the shirt color is to show the public you're looking for a job. Just some thoughts, you can only take from the working for so long before they start to see that it's easier to just be on government assistance.",1
9,"They should because it's a drain on the economy and the country. People are taking advantage over the programme, and all the system is doing is putting the governments money in the hands of drug addicts and criminals.

I CAN'T provide for my kids as well as those who supposedly are ""Under Privileged"". This is a system and everybody outside the honest working Americans know how to work it. it's not the fault of my State nor my Country that somebody got pregnant and can't feed their Kids.",1
9,"I'm tired of the massive handouts to people who refuse to work or take responsibility for poor behavior. their are already programs in place for helping the disabled and elderly, even though they are also full of fraud and abuse but the welfare programs are a disaster.

9,"We can not support out current level of spending. We are NOT the richest nation in the world, our middle class is getting smaller and is the 27th richest, NOT the 1st. The welfare system should be limited;however, not totally eliminated. Anyone with a real disability should have some sort of safety net to fall back into, but the unemployed should only be able to stay on welfare for a certain amount of time, because otherwise we end up with the people that just sit around and collect welfare checks, or even require that the recipients give the government some sort of service, further cutting the extra spending.",1
9,Too many people depending on the system. Therefore costing the working American class too much tax money. I could see if they were not physically able. Let's take care of them but not just because some white woman got 10 kids and not by the same dad or not even married. I see people like that go into walmart and buy 800 dollars worth of groceries at a time and we pay for them.That makes me mad.,1

I get an hour for lunch but that isn't enough these days, I can't even get something to eat and go back to work in an hour because all the people clogging up the streets on their way to pick up their welfare check. This has to end!",1
9,"Too many people feel that government help is their RIGHT, not a privilege, and they pass this way of thinking on to their children. This is crazy, how many MILLIONS of dollars have been given to people that sit on their ass and do nothing but raise more section 8 children. I am sick and tired of my tax money going to support these parasites. Everyone needs a hand once in awhile, but it should be temporary, and yes, accidental children do happen, but hey, after the first one, you kind of know how this happens, so make an effort to stop having children you can't support. As for Food stamps, my God, why are we giving people CREDIT CARDS with money on them to buy groceries? This is crazy! When I was young, and you needed food, you went to the local food bank and they gave you a box of government surplus food, you did not get to pick and choose what you wanted, you ate the food and were happy for it. I work my but off and often times don't have enough money to last through the month, but guess what, I can't get assistance, why, because I am doing the right thing and working, the government takes a dim view of that. Wake up Americans, limit welfare to 6 to 8 weeks, TOPS, anyone can find a job in that time, it may not be a great job, but it is money coming in. Food Stamps, do away with them, go back to food lines! Section 8, no way, their is low rent housing, if that is all you can afford, then that is where you live, No one owes you ANYTHING! Thanks for letting me rant, I feel a little better now.",1
9,"The government is punishing people for being successful by over taxing them. A majority of people that receive government assistance don't need it. Instead increase minimum wage, create new jobs and make people work for the things they want. I have struggled putting myself through college only taking 2 courses a semester so I could work full time to support myself. I refrained from having a child until I could afford one since I will not rely on the system to cover medical expenses and childcare. Make people become responsible again. People who have abused the system have ruined it for people who need it.",1
9,Welfare just feeds the parasites. I live in a country with more poor people than North America. We have no welfare to lean back on so we WORK HARD. The result is obvious. Welfare slows down the progress of the poor by letting them think it's okay to be poor. The incentive of working your way out of poverty diminishes while at the same time making everyone else poorer by funneling their wealth to the poor. So I disagree welfare does not BENEFIT us all it does the opposite. Bleeding out is not a benefit to anyone. We don't live in an ideal world. Stop pretending that liberalism has helped anyone. It hasn't.,1
9,"Far too many people grow up on welfare as children and just continue on as adults getting benefits. I once asked a kindergartner what he wanted to be when he grew up and he didn't understand. I explained about getting a job and having money to buy things. He looked at me and said, ""The check comes on Friday."" Sums it up right their. No motivation to work when the check just shows up in the mailbox! The system is very broken!",1
9,Honestly we as working citizens should be the ones to vote for what our tax money is used for non taxpayers should have no say their should at least be max time limits on collecting and drug tests to be approved for welfare otherwise I am against this hand out from my pocket every week,1
9,"I only want to be responsible for my own children, which I haven't had yet, because I can't afford to. Welfare recipients should be drug tested and their income should slowly decline to motivate them to get a job. So much money gets deducted from my paychecks for years, it limits me from opening my own business faster.",1
9,I think they should end it. I have a few disabilities myself that does interfere with my work and I could get ssi if I wanted but instead I get up I go to work and make the best of it. I earned the money I work for. I didn't sit at home waiting for a government check every month. I don't spend it needlessly.,1
9,"I am ALL for helping people who are in need, but unfortunately that is NOT what our system is set up to do. It may have started that way, but we have gotten away from it somewhere along the way. Welfare is promoting laziness and not working. We give people who don't have jobs free housing, money, food, and a cell phone for what?? Nothing! If we stopped welfare people would have to learn to live within their means, get (and keep) jobs, and stop having more children than they can support. All of these things are things that the rest of us do and then our checks are cut short to support those who are sitting at home doing nothing but drawing money out of our checks. Some serious changes need to be made in our system SOON because we are creating a big mess that we may never be able to get out of.",1
9,"Since the things man needs for survival have to be produced, and nature does not guarantee the success of any human endeavor, their is not and cannot be any such thing as a guaranteed economic security. The employer who gives you a job, has no guarantee that his business will remain in existence, that his customers will continue to buy his products or services. The customers have no guarantee that they will always be able and willing to trade with him, no guarantee of what their needs, choices and incomes will be in the future. If you retire to a self-sustaining farm, you have no guarantee to protect you from what a flood or a hurricane might do to your land and your crops. If you surrender everything to the government and give it total power to plan the whole economy, this will not guarantee your economic security, but it will guarantee the descent of the entire nation to a level of miserable poverty—as the practical results of every totalitarian economy, communist or fascist, have demonstrated. Morally, the promise of an impossible “right” to economic security is an infamous attempt to abrogate the concept of rights. It can and does mean only one thing: a promise to enslave the men who produce, for the benefit of those who don't. “If some men are entitled by right to the products of the work of others, it means that those others are deprived of rights and condemned to slave labor.” (“Man’s Rights” in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.) their can be no such thing as the right to enslave, IE., the right to destroy rights. Morally and economically, the welfare state creates an ever accelerating downward pull. Morally, the chance to satisfy demands by force spreads the demands wider and wider, with less and less pretense at justification. Economically, the forced demands of one group create hardships for all others, thus producing an inextricable mixture of actual victims and plain parasites. Since need, not achievement, is held as the criterion of rewards, the government necessarily keeps sacrificing the more productive groups to the less productive, gradually chaining the top level of the economy, then the next level, then the next. (How else are unachieved rewards to be provided?) there are two kinds of need involved in this process: the need of the group making demands, which is openly proclaimed and serves as cover for another need, which is never mentioned—the need of the power-seekers, who require a group of dependent favor-recipients in order to rise to power. Altruism feeds the first need, statism feeds the second, Pragmatism blinds everyone—including victims and profiteers—not merely to the deadly nature of the process, but even to the fact that a process is going on.",1
9,"Most Americans learn from our parents/families, following the path in which they are raised on...Lazy or motivated...Unfortunately you do see the same pattern within the welfare system ""LAZY"". This needs to be stopped...Daily I see patients that are on welfare and what I observe is they occupy nicer vehicles, nicer clothes, manicures, etc. ""Something is not right"". Why do the motivated and hard working Americans need to support such selfish individuals who make excuses why they can not fend for themselves...I can not find one reason to support these type of individuals. As for the single mother excuse...Most could be married to the father of the child(father employed w/ benefits) but choose not to so they are able to collect...""living pretty good""....Solution: the government should just help with daycare and stop WELFARE/FOOD STAMPS/FREE EDUCATION...""STOP MAKING IT EASY""...We need to come up with a better plan ""ONLY"" help the individuals who deserve it...",1
9,"Continuing to provide for all creates a permanent underclass who are wholly dependent on the government and see no incentive to stop the cycle. it's akin to feeding a wild animal to the point to where it can no longer hunt and fend for themselves. Many people choose the benefits because in many cases, Uncle Sam will be their to provide more than the available men in the area. When combated with 40+% unemployment in many urban areas, the men are seen an useless. Yet, we continue to reward women for their choices, and continue to denigrate a man for doing the same thing. If a woman has three children and can't support them, the system is their to help. If a man has three children and can't support them, then he gets put into the system and is threatened with jail sentences. Women are not held accountable, hence why we have runaway rates of out of wedlock births and fatherlessness. If welfare benefits are eliminated, then people will be forced to learn to pool together and work together. Within time, people will learn again how to support themselves and raise families. Without Uncle Sam, people will now work with real men. Another thing that should also be don't is go one step further then Plan B contraceptives and allow Plan A (birth control) to be available over the counter. Many people don't get them because of our archaic laws requiring a doctor's visit and high prescription costs to protect themselves against pregnancy. So many simply don't care, because hey, Uncle Sam is their to save the day.",1

I see it everyday. it's really disappointing to believe that's where hard working Americans money goes to. These people spend their time getting high and screwing around making more babies for the government to raise. Honestly it is a never ending cycle. They raise their children to be like this too so as long as we hand out they will keep continuing to put their hands out and continue to expect more for less. At least make drug testing mandatory in ALL states! Our country is in the crapper. I want us to stop giving $1 billion in charity too. China owns us, they don't need it. So we give China charity money and continue to pay off our debt to them? I'm sorry but that doesn't make sense. The United States is handing out money to everyone and it needs to stop. Stop ALL handouts! To everyone! It may cause turmoil in the begging but I bet a lot more people get a job and keep it. I bet we industrialize even more, I bet we will prosper because everyone has to get off their butts to make a dollar. GOD BLESS AMERICA!

I HAVE to live within my means and I refuse to be on welfare. I have more pride in myself. But people should really be out looking for jobs. I know, it's tough, but after a search that lasted a couple months I found one. Pay could better, but I have pride and now it is not the government's job to fully take care of you and pay things. Most people think it's actually free money. Nothing is free in this world. You pay a price for something even if it isn't a cent. People are getting sick and tired of working so hard, to barely reach ends meet and having their money stolen by the government to pay for people who don't lift for a finger and only lift it for the remote and opening the mailbox. I myself, am tired of it.",1

But the current state of the US Welfare needs to end. there are too many people that take benefits for granted and abuse the system. -there should be a time limit on receiving benefits. After which you have to re-apply. -If you receive benefits, you should be forced to do community service. -there should be better background checks and more accountability afterwards. -If you receive benefits, if or when you qualify for social security payments, your payments should be lowered. Basically a ""you put back in what you take"" type of program.",1
9,"When I speak about ending welfare I don't mean programs such as Social Security or unemployment benefits( which is a from of insurance that employers must pay into), or programs of a similar nature. What I and I think most are talking about are programs such as Section 8; which provides vouchers for low income families to provide for rent( either completely or at a reduced rate) based on their income level. The problem with programs like this is that it provides little incentive for participants to exit these programs. I use section 8 as an example. More often than not you can have several generations of a family participating in the program, and many of them have no intention of ending the cycle. While it is not necessarily fair to generalize it speaks to systemic problem in the system that needs to be corrected. If you are going to have programs like this then you must have a time limit. If you allow someone to remain on a program like section 8 or even food stamps indefinitely then what incentive is their stop using. More often than not the response is that system is stacked against these people, and that it is our responsibility to provide for those who can't provide for themselves. This is great except that those who are most vocal are also often times the ones who are benefiting from such situations. The truth is that there are opportunities for people to change their situations that don't require hand outs. Instead, we should be providing ""hand ups."" One of the major divides that is often times used reason for such disadvantages is education. Wither it is through loans, scholarships,grants, or perhaps even the GI Bill there are plenty of opportunities for people to obtain skills that will allow them to move out of the minimum wage income bracket. If you don't think you can deal or payback loans then do what I did and join the Army. If you want to talk about how unfair things are then my first question is going to be ""what have you don't to fight against 'disadvantage' that you perceive. The only way to fight the ""war on poverty"" is set time limits incentives for improving your own situation. If you are not willing to fight to improve your life then why should I fight to maintain your current standard of living. Self-reliance use to be something we associated with positive emotions and character traits. Perhaps it is time to return to these ideals.",1
9,The more and more people are on it the the more money the government will have to pay out and besides most of the people on welfare have a job and with the money they get from the government they spend on booze and cigarettes. And the people who don't have jobs spend the money on booze and cigarettes.,1
9,"Like the great Dave Ramsey says, ""if you can't afford it don't buy it."" If these people stopped buying things they don't need and can't afford, then they wouldn't need welfare. I'm tired of helping these people get out of the funk they put themselves into. If they really need welfare, I'm sorry but the government needs to monitor the system and weed out those that are abusing it. I'm tired of hundreds of dollars going to people I can't even access as a public document. I should be able to get online and see who is receiving my hard earned money. If cell phone records are public record then so should welfare. We have a right to know!",1
9,To many hard working Americans are paying for the drugs and nice new white sneakers for the people on welfare. Why should they work when they get it for free. I believe if you are given everything there is no need for you to work. If welfare wasn't a thing you would be more motivated to earn a living because it was that or starve.,1
9,"I understand that everyone needs a chance to get back on their feet. However, when generation after generation makes welfare a lifestyle, it causes a burden on taxpayers. Welfare should be a one time thing that aids a family get back to supporting their own household. When a family is on it for years, and then the children and grandchildren grow up and are also depended on the system, then there's a problem!",1
9,"We are driving ourselves deeper into debt with these policies that simply don't benefit anyone in the long run. Not only that but welfare doesn't help the intended population, instead most of the money ends up in the black market or in people's pockets who don't truly need any financial help and apply simply out of greed.",1
9,"Welfare programs do nothing to aid these people in coming off of it and providing for their families. In many states welfare pays more than minimum wage which makes it so that it's better for them to be on welfare than working. Either lower welfare so much that they HAVE to find work to survive, or cut it out completely.",1
9,"it's easy, this country is based on an American Dream founded by hard work. If you don't want to work, starve and stop having kids. Don't complain when it's the ""man"" that keeps you down. You keep yourself down in those hoods you live in. You're teaching your children the same lazy values you have. Now I have to pay for ""Obamacare"" because more lazy people don't want to work.",1
9,The majority of people in America feel entitled to receive things for free. They feel the government and the world owes them just because they were born. It should a requirement that you have a job and try to help yourself before you are able to receive any assistance. You are encouraged not to work with all these lavish incentives. Food stamps are their to help not be your only source of food. A supplement not a lifestyle.,1
9,"Life is not guaranteed to be easy. their are a lot of things that can happen that can set a person or family back financially. That being said, the people of the United States, through the government, are not their to provide you a lifestyle in perpetuity. Welfare, food stamps, Section 8 housing, free cell phones, free medical all needs to stop! You want to have things in life? Go out and earn them. If you can't afford them, you don't deserve them.",1

9,"I have never seen one person on disability or welfare that did without cigarettes or an iPhone. it's funny to me how all of these people can spend over $300.00 a month on those so called ""necessities"" and those of who choose to get an education or try and better ourselves get hit so hard in taxes that we can not improve our lives. No one should get for free what another one has to work for! I'm all for helping those who truly need it, but I need a logical explanation of how they can afford all the finer things in life but not be able to buy food and insurance.... I have to, but I also have to work 2 jobs to provide for my family! I see way to much abuse of this system.... It was meant for short term help in a crisis, not a way of life and to pass from one generation to the next. If you can't afford the children you have, quit having more! I'm tired of working and providing for those who don't... My daughter had to go without medication because I couldn't afford it, however, the woman behind me with her fake nails and iPhone whipped out her Medicaid card and got it for free! How do you explain that! It needs to stop!",1
9,"At least, try to be part of the American working tax-paying population. Welfare was designed to care for people during hard times until they got back to work and on their feet, again. Not to live off of for generations. it's not a racial, religious, or regional issue. it's become an issue of people thinking they are owed something just for living here. Needed or not, enough is enough.",1
9,"Elderly, sick, vets: yes. If you can walk and talk, guess what? You can work. If you can get to the welfare office on your own, you can get to work. So sick of people who are becoming professional welfare benefactors. Freaking generations of family dedicated to the welfare system. Meanwhile I have seen people, disabled people, who don't need to work working. it's not complicated, you see the person asking for welfare, if he looks like he can be put to work, say no, get a JOB. The only people requesting welfare for all are people on welfare!",1
9,"I work. I cannot afford health insurance or even luxuries like Cable TV. However, I pay for all of the services I cannot afford. Services such as health insurance for ""needy families,"" food stamps, free ""Obama phones"" and the like. I pay for these services, yet my children and I are uninsured. Why is this? Because I make more than the federal poverty guidelines, so I am unable to even purchase insurance that covers anything beyond catastrophic injury such as heart attack. That catastrophic insurance is not within my budget either! I haven't gone to a salon in over a decade, I don't purchase DVDs or other unnecessary items, I often have to borrow from friends or family to put fuel in my care until payday, and yet other people receive checks for underachievement? This is not justice, and it is definitely not social justice. it's disincentivizing hard work. I should not have to pay into a service, then be told I cannot use that very service I pay for simply because I pay for it. Unacceptable!",1
9,"If you can't afford, don't buy it. If you can't support yourself, you shouldn't have children, if you need something, where there's a will, there's a way. If you were given free money every month, would you respect money? I wouldn't . Since when is it ok to be a leech in our society? The only folks that deserve free money are the vets, disabled and elderly, that's it! If you can't afford to live here, go back to where you came from or pitch a tent.",1
9,"I thought I was a democrat and I'm definitely not a republican--what to do? Both are so far now to the left and right, it leaves many of us feeling our votes are meaningless. As a Registered Nurse, a true Christian and a member of the human race, I feel compassion for those who are truly disabled, poor and elderly with little support. I see Certified Nursing Assistant, single moms, working for $10.00/hr doing everything to stay off the welfare rolls but then I see my stepfathers married granddaughter with professional teaching skills having her 4th or 5th child, nice housing, cell phones, big screen HDTVs, new care etc...Opening admitting not going to work so she can receive welfare, medicaid and food stamps...What's up with that? She was reported for welfare fraud but they did nothing. We should have social security for our elderly, we should have healthcare for all at a reasonable cost (get rid of the profiteers in that industry), and we should care for the poor. What choices are we presented with? The left wants expand the system and the right wants to obliterate it. Why can we get the abuse of welfare and medicaid under control. The abuses are obvious to the everyday working people. As far as the healthcare system, I am 50 and I sure as heck don't want a voucher to go out and find my own insurance. My husband and I once had a business and so no employer healthcare insurance plan and the rates for insurance were unbelievable just a few years ago...I can imagine what they are now. The for-profit hospitals in Texas just keep opening bigger and plusher hospitals and PROFITING. Non-profit hospitals..Is that an oxymoron or what?? Insurance companies are making huge profits too.. What is wrong with our country.",1
9,"I think from an economics perspective, you have to look at people's ability to act correctly with the power they're given. That's not all though. In America, we have the highest standard of living, and in my opinions also the highest percentage of tightasses. I think disability should go as well. Veterans benefits should be a light incentive. Basically everything should be paid with cash. The reason being, America (the country with the highest production efficiency) would find spots for people after the system had time to correct itself. Ask yourself this. How can you spend money to create wealth? I just know this isn't going to happen though. :/",1
9,People who are receiving welfare are not doing anything in their power to change that. They abusing the system and have become very lazy. They have more kids just to qualify for more money. They encourage their daughters to have kids and leave the boyfriend so they also receive more money. For these people living on welfare are accustomed to receive this money and wont do anything to change it.,1
9,"I often hear that SOCIAL SECURITY will run out of money which I have paid in and had no choice and this concerns me. However, I never hear of WELFARE running out of money. And the funny thing is we all have WORKED for OUR SOCIAL SECURITY. I still find it amazing how an immigrant who comes to the USA from a third world country to better themselves, has the ability to collect social security and never has paid a dime into the system. However, someone who has paid in dearly over the years may not have an opportunity to ever spend one dime to what they contributed.",1
9,"People should not have children they cannot support, cloth, feed, and house. Also, educate and teach to aspire to be a productive human being. A helping hand is one thing but to just have child after child after child knowing you, yourself have no future and no father in the child's life is inhumane and irresponsible. The government cutting elderly and disabled to support this behavior is absurd.",1
9,"I'm sick of my husband and I working over 40 hours a week to try to support our two daughters and ourselves and once we get paid, bam! our paycheck is gone because of paying all of our bills and rent. But even then not all of our bills get paid because we don't have any extra money. Welfare should be temporary and everyone should be drug tested! So sick of people sitting on their butts and collecting welfare while the real people that are struggling are out their busting their butts working 40+ hours a week just to get by and hardly gets to spend time with their family. I say the whole US should stop working and then apply for welfare and see what the government does then. it's time to end welfare and start helping the middle class!",1
9,"My money should go towards paying MY bills and providing for MY family not taking care of YOU! Welfare was originally set up to TEMPORARILY assistance those who fell into hard times; and people were meant to only use the bare minimum they needed and get off it as quickly as possible. Yet, the abuse of the system is so wide spread. Why get a job when you can have other workers pay for your housing, food, child care, utilities, medical bills, and hand over ""cash assistance"" based on how many babies you pop out -- babies you can't afford on your own! No. I am NOT responsible for you or your kids. Take care of yourself and your own family! Furthermore, I am in debt up to my ears for my college degree. I am paying off my college loans. Why should I pay yours, too? Get your own debt.",1
9,"We have 2 full time incomes in our home and scrape to make ends meet. We don't live outside of our means. Stop 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc. Generational welfare. Help for a limited amount of time.

HELP NOT ENTITLEMENT!!!",1

No system is perfect, but we should strive to make it better at least.",1
9,"I currently live in Baltimore, MD. I am tired of the welfare abuse that I see here daily. I am sick in tired of section 8 ruining hardworking neighborhoods. Going to the supermarket is absolutely unjust. I see individuals buying top brand grocery and meats with their ""independence cards"" which are food stamps. When they exit the supermarkets they have Mercedes or BMW's with their freshly dry cleaned clothing hanging in the back. I understand everyone may need some help sometimes in their life but their needs to be reform to the current system. People are just milking the system for generations!",1
9,"I'm sick of working hard, putting in 12 hours a day 60 hours a week and working another job to supplement my income. I'm a teacher who teaches families who use government assistance.

9,"Life is about dealing with consequences and their effects. Now, I don't think there is one of us in the world who should not feel sorry for rape victims, especially if the victim gets pregnant. A winning court case would allow the victim to get welfare. However, the minority should not guide the majority. People are always wanting to take advantage of a system; it's in our nature to get the most bang for our buck. it's more financially beneficial to be on welfare then to get a job in most states, so they'll take advantage of it. Having sex can get you pregnant, regardless of what type of birth control you use. The public should not be held responsible for the screw-ups of people putting a gamble on their future for a moment of pleasure. Stopping welfare, with the exceptions of rape victims, will remove the incentive of ""taking the easy way out"" in life.",1
9,"Government should create opportunities and better infrastructure instead of giving people incentive to stay poor. You can't help people by just giving money. Trust me! I am from one of the poorest countries, but my people work and we don't have welfare programs. Honestly, in my culture people would rather die than staying on welfare programs. We gotta instill that and change the mentality of the people in the US.",1
9,"The economy is already bad enough as it is... We are paying for all these lazy people to sit around and do nothing. I understand some people really do need it but put them on it for about a month while the look for a job...

My husband and I have great jobs but we budget what we spend at the store there are times I wish I had over 600 dollars for food a month. We work and have to pay for daycare, food, medical bills, pre school if we didn't work all that would be free but we have to pay and that is a lot of money out of our checks. it's not fair for the people that do work I would live to sit at home with my kids everyday and have everything paid for but I could never do it. their are jobs people just think they are to good for them or don't try because they know they will have it hard but we all do at times.",1
9,"Welfare is a road to hell. Government handouts steal dignity from both the overtaxed middle class, and the underemployed needy. I believe giving to a Church or charitable organization is more appropriate to help those in need. Welfare encourages irresponsible behavior, and demoralizes those who think they are getting free money. Nothing in life is free; work is not a choice. Welfare compromises the integrity of all involved.",1
9,"Welfare should be ended as this country knows it and a new plan put into place. This will eliminate laziness, addicts, teens having babies so they can go on welfare, welfare as a way of life and most fraud. 1) Welfare has a 2 year lifetime limit. You can use it for up to 2 years in your lifetime. Person must be at least 21 years of age with previous job history in order to get any type of benefits. 2) Only legal US citizens can get any type of assistance from the government. Illegal alien = 0 money or help from our government in any from. 3) Drug test required once a month. Positive result = 0 money for your lifetime. 4) Proof of job hunting required to continue receiving any assistance. 5) Food stamps work like the WIC program. Only healthy foods can be purchased. No junk food, paper products, toiletries, processed frozen foods, etc--with same restrictions as above mentioned. Photo required on the card and must be presented with a valid picture id in order to use the card. If this was the way welfare and food stamps worked, this country would save billions of dollars, eliminating fraud, waste and abuse. You either get a job or you starve, simple as that. This would eliminate Obama's belief that we must grant amnesty to illegal aliens in order to fill all the jobs Americans don't want to do. If people were forced to work, they would. Our ancestors didn't have welfare and they survived just fine. their were better morals and values back then as well. Our society has become more violent and self orientated. People want something for nothing and Obama is wasting hard working people's tax dollars to fund the lifestyles of illegals, drug addicts and leeches. Dignity and respect needs to be emphasized.",1
9,"there's so much abuse of the system right now. The whole welfare system including free healthcare for the ""less fortunate"" should be shut down. Leave the people that will not work for what they have to rot in the gutter. People on these programs live better then some college educated people that have full time work and families.",1
9,"In order for America to make crucial progress in it's struggling economy, we need to stop enabling those citizens to ""give up"" and engage in the ""lifestyle"" of welfare. When parent's of the welfare culture are having children for the sole purpose of another check, these children are more than likely not going to be provided with the tools and upbringing required to shape their mentality as contributors to America. Their overall schema is composed of of characteristics such as entitlement, resentment and victimized mentalities. Before, there was an embarrassment or shame that went along with receiving ""aid"" from the taxpayers. However, do to desensitization and shamelessness of the rapidly growing culture of welfare, if all your family and neighbors are on it, the less guilty recipients feel. When you take away the incentive to contribute to the american economy, why do so? If a person can have cable, transportation, smartphones, and all of the other luxuries of life, and not have to work for it? What does it teach our youth? Welfare not only punishes those who work hard, but slaps them in the face by polluting the country with people that cost money to take care of and has very little positive outputs for American society. If America was a ""business"" like the president has stated, why would a business buy a piece of equipment for $100 if it only ended up making them$1? And continue to buy more and more just like it, knowing that it could never possibly pay for itself? How long will the hard working middle class continue to work for those who refuse? All able bodied people who have been receiving aid with a part -time or no job, finds it difficult to be motivated to work hard for almost the same amount as they get handed to them. The only explication for enabling a culture to reproduce many american citizens (voters) who will be born into a world that hard work i viewed as an inconvenience, will look at the government as saviors from the only thing that keeps this country's economy alive. Most don't care or have ever wondered where their ""free money"" comes from, Could this be a distinct correlation with their educational efforts? Or having such strong defense mechanisms to avoid any realistic guilt they may feel? (which could correlate from their entitlement mentalities). If letting this get out of hand and be taken advantage of as much as it has, when the answer is obvious...., why would the government ever want to enable an entire culture of people who are extremely dependent on them???...Hmmm? If welfare is not a catalyst to an agenda that will make the United States a socialist country, then why do they make it so easy? In so many cases, at the end of the day ,the only reward for working hard is the humbling feeling...???? Wake up!",1
9,"I know it would be impossible to just stop welfare. A lifestyle has been created in which government assistance is counted on just like I count on my paycheck. What makes my stance so difficult are the children of welfare recipients, they can't help that their parents overspend, or won't work, or have made other bad decisions that cause them to be too poor to live by their own means. I've been a worker since I was 15 years old. Full time in high school, full time in college, I did my 4 years in the military, and I work full time now, of course. If I can do it, so can every other able bodied person in the USA. Heck, I need people who want to work, but when I call out for them, about 1 out of 5 do a satisfactory job. They all want the same pay though, and the ones who show up late and sometimes strung-out think they deserve more then everyone else. their is a place for every blue-collar American worker, but with the law and the government enabling and even praising bad behavior, those workers aren't happy with what jobs are available to them. We need everyone to work, and to take pride in what they do!",1
9,The people living of of the section 8 are abusing the program and using it to live freely without trying to find a job or making their lives productive. The welfare program hasn't ended because these people keep voting for democrats who don't want to end this program. It is wrong and a waste of taxpayers money.,1
9,"Welfare is ridiculous. I work and go to school (both full time) and barely get by. I'm tired of paying for lazy people who sit around and do nothing with their lives besides popping out babies. You seriously should not be having kids if you cannot afford them. Why do I have to pay for someone else to have a child? Why do I have to pay for someone else's food? I can barely afford groceries myself. Why do I have to pay for someone else to live for free? When I can barely afford my own rent. Let's try helping out the middle class for once and like someone else said ""how about promoting education, drug testing/screening, and having a time limit. How about giving alternatives to welfare, like helping people get off it. <---- Good luck with that because nobody is going to want to get off welfare because it's such a sweet, easy ride in life. Maybe I should just quit my job and have a couple of babies, I wouldn't mind free food and free rent!",1
9,"Welfare should be ended but that doesn't mean let people starve. It means promote education and get able bodied people off government support. The only time the government or state should help with the poor is if it's a recession, but it shouldn't be a salary thing. Especially when people have the nerve to have kids while on it and choose not to get an education. We can be compassionate but let's not be enablers.",1
9,"The government should not be stealing from the rich to give to the poor, they rich works hard for their money and just because some people decide to be lazy and spend all their money on drugs doesn't mean they should get to take someone else's. Just because one person is suffering! Why should the rest of the country?",1
9,Single women who continue to have children knowing that they cannot support them are taking advantage of the system as well as increasing the burden of tax paying citizens to support not only their children but them as well. If they continue this burden on the taxpayers their should be mandatory birth control. Welfare support should be available for only those who have a legitimate need for it.,1
9,"Life is hard for mankind. Taking it easy on the labors of others is very unfair. The reason why the economy is truly bad is because of eternal welfare. We have all this production going towards people who are capable of working, and not receiving production back from them. A reform is needed, and a limit on welfare.",1
9,"it's not fair and altruism cannot be mandated. It breeds resentment and reinforces bad behavior. Both parties are hurt by the redistribution of wealth. And that's just theory on human nature. As for the constitution and freedom, I feel chained to my government. And wasn't the role of the government security and infrastructure when most successful?",1
9,"It would free up revenue. Everyone always talks about how social security running out of money, but never welfare. SO people who worked hard and paid taxes will go without, but not the people who don't work. Make them get jobs, and then they can earn their own money. I just believe no one should get a free ride.",1
9,"Welfare never gives back. It only takes. Each year it cost more and more, yet more and more don't grow away from it. People are brought up in it and trained in it as a way of life. This should never have become the chosen life path that it is today. It is a cancer to the well being of all in the country. Giving out in a manner like welfare never solves misery in a life. Only by determination and wanting to be a part of society will a person feel meaningful. Welfare supports a deteriorating humanity by removing purpose and the need to try. When the stasis of welfare is removed from the system, millions will grow above it, and begin coming together to grow in ways we have not yet seen within communities.",1
9,"Welfare is a subsidy, and work is taxed. When you tax something, you always get a shortage of it. When you subsidize something, you always get too much of it. How is the bottom part of society going to elevate themselves when it subsidizes illegitimacy? As Thomas Sowell pointed out, that no nation has ever prospered by having a growing number of parasites living off those who produce. The Welfare state hasn't worked in any country EVER! Nowhere has it elevated the poor. All welfare does is make the poor more comfortable. You hear liberals always talking about how this works in Sweden or Scandinavia. But, that is a society that has had a homogeneous culture that had a high degree of equality and cooperation well before the welfare state. Yet, Liberals like to claim it is these left wing policies that have enabled this. Not true. it's culture that matters most. The problem is even in Sweden this model is crumbling as the middle class is disappearing because of all of the taxes they have to pay. For a country to prosper you have to produce wealth. Welfare consumes it and de-incentivizes it.",1
9,"How a country prospers is by not taking pie from the rich but making a bigger pie by having more incentive. Workers on welfare don't produce wealth, they consume it. When companies are forced to pay for this largess, they move overseas. More welfare means more poverty and misery. Detroit!",1
9,"I am sick of the lazy and worthless people that are young, healthy and completely capable of working and contributing to our society instead of leaching off the system. Before we had welfare, people did whatever they could and used ANY means of support to care for themselves or their family. It is so disgusting that approximately half of this country sit on their rear-ends, stuff their fat faces, drive new cars, eat out all the time, send their brats to paid for daycare, while the other half of this country barely scrape buy, working hard at an honest day's pay.",1
9,"Welfare was meant as a temporary measure to help out temporarily when people needed a little help but it has become something upon which people, especially able-bodied people, have become dependent upon. Dependence on government handouts does harm both to the people receiving the assistance and also the people who work hard and pay their taxes because they have to pay for the money given to the ""poor"". The old saying ""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach him how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"" applies. Welfare has become the ""giving the man a fish"" instead of ""teaching him how to fish"". People who are able-bodied should be given just enough assistance to survive but not so much that they become comfortable and thus lose the motivation and incentive to do for themselves. We cannot sustain having nearly half of the population of the United States dependent upon the other half for their living. It is literally stealing from those who produce and giving it to those who will not work. It is far better for people to get help from their friends, family, neighbors and others in their community then to turn to the government because only the government benefits from having more and more people dependent on them. Those who cannot work deserve our compassion and help but those who can work but refuse to work don't deserve anything. America is a land of opportunity and where more poor have been uplifted from poverty than anywhere else in the world..Not by government handouts but by the sweat of their brow and an unrestricted free market where anyone can do for themselves if they take risks and earn it by virtue of their merit. Only once the welfare state of dependence on government handouts will true economic prosperity and liberty return to this nation. All Americans will ultimately be better off for it once the chains of their servitude to their overseers and masters in Washington DC are broken once and for all. So the choice to every American is to live free and do for themselves or be slaves to government handouts.",1
9,"Some people not all people take welfare for granted. Some people keep having babies because they get more and more free things like a phone,money,rebate on a rebate on taxes and other things. They don't have to pay any health insurance or health bills for themselves and their families. it's not fair when people who do need assistance can't get it because they make too much money.",1
9,"This country has lost its way of life, people used to look up to Americans for work ethic. Now this country has become a joke full of lazy people and welfare has become a way of life. It has become so much easier for people to file for assistance and claim that they were fired or unable to find employment without actually seeking employment.",1
9,"Welfare was not created as a career choice, generations of welfare families now exist, the name ""temporary assistance for needy families"" pretty much says what the programs intention was, but there has been nothing temporary about the system at this point. Putting lifetime caps hasn't worked, people have kids knowing they plan on collecting welfare. People on welfare have more children per household then working families, the more they have the more money they get the system is broken and why the money continues to flow is beyond me. Social security is going bankrupt when hard working people paid into it yet welfare is going strong with more and more welfare children being born, but the welfare system isn't bankrupt? How is that even possible?",1
9,"The intended welfare system started as ""temporary assistance"". In today's world, welfare has become a way of life. Make more children, get more money for the rest of your life. This does not take into account the amount of welfare abuse going on and draining the well of the working person. If welfare were to end, this would also indirectly end (over time) racism.",1
9,"I believe the original concept behind the Welfare program has become misconstrued. The program was never originally meant to last forever and the concept behind it was to help people during the great depression, however that time period has long gone and past. their is also the growing majority of people who seem to think that they are entitled to these services for nothing, and that they exist solely to provide them with the means to survive without having to work, all while still claiming more and more children, which is turn will lead to more generations of future welfare dependents. Also what about the people who truly needed, the more and more people that clog up the system making claims means that there is less money going around and let tell you I am certain not every welfare claim is 100% accurate or deserving. Yet the people who are actually disabled now have to scrap by on less then they could have gotten had only 50% of the actual people receiving been honest and stopped putting themselves into the system on false claims, or creating their own disabilities or welfare qualifying situations intentionally.",1
9,"Welfare is a great idea, however, in the real world their isn't enough moderation. Too many people take advantage of the assistance and never motivate themselves from having to use it. It becomes too easy and to convenient to do otherwise. If a system is going to be available their needs to be a rigorous monitoring of the people who need it.",1
9,"Simply put, I have been eligible for section 8 and food stamps for years, but have NEVER applied. Do you know why? Because I can work my minimum wage job in Philadelphia and PROVIDE FOR MYSELF. I think the eligibility requirements are entirely too lax. It encourages people to abuse the system. I also, am aware that i can not afford children, so my boyfriend and I have used contraceptives from day one. People don't need free money, housing, and food, they need to learn how to provide those things for themselves and realize that there are consequences to their actions.",1

9,"I am tired of working and working and NOT able to afford insurance for my wife, tired of not having ANY money left over for ANYTHING including fixing and maintaining the house, tired of watching the lazy sluggards in the grocery store pull out their food stamp card with steaks in their cart while we have no choice but to scrimp and save and eat noodles. Tired of the sluggards having premium health care while my wife and I have to rely on HOME remedies.

9,"Come on everyone, let's be honest. Isn't it fair that you should get to keep the money you earn? I can understand taxes because the government is supposedly what keeps our country running. But paying for other people who chose to stand on the shoulders of us just because they chose to take the wrong path? That's just stupid. WE worked HARD for our lives and what do we get? Lazy people who ""steal"" our hard earned money! These people are taking the easy way out; not going to college or working hard like we have. Do YOU think it's right for someone to work hard all day and then have some lazy, unemployed person take that hard earned money away from you? That's just outrageous. And if anyone goes around saying, ""Oh it's not their fault, their job doesn't provide enough money for them to take care of their family,"" then those people don't know what they're saying. First of all, it is their fault because they most likely chose a low paying job like working at a fast food restaurant. And even if they have a steady job, it's their choice to have kids!!!! In the end, it always ties up to them. I'm not trying to be a bad person, but honestly, I have no relationship with the people my money is going to and I would like to provide for MYSELF and MY family, not some other family who can't handle themselves.

9,"it's very unfortunate that individuals who continue to abuse the Welfare system, have ruined the concept of this temporary safety net for everyone else. Unless the Welfare system is fixed, it needs to go. I am NOT unsympathetic to those out their who really DO need temporary assistance such as the disabled, elderly, or families simply experiencing hard times. But I personally would much rather see my tax dollars being used towards more positive and progressive endeavors, such as financing text books and supplies for students of all levels of education, building better roads, etc. Rather then see my tax dollars being misused to help the selfish degenerates collecting Welfare checks who care little to nothing about themselves or anyone else.",1
9,I would rather cut welfare all together but am willing to just get rid of some of the people. Cutting off the drug addicts is one thing that makes people happier with welfare but then there are those that say testing welfare recipients for drug use violates their constitutional rights. You should know that nowhere in our constitution does it say we have to give drug addicts money so they can continue to feed their bad habit. It has nothing to do with reasonable suspicion if you work at a food establishment I don't want you to be doing drugs and neither should your employer. The only valid reason not to do drug test is that it won't save any money but if it did cost the same you would definitely choose to cut the drug addicts so that spread their addiction. A simpler and better solution is to at least take off all the sex offenders and criminals. And if you think everyone deserves a second chance then only cut the people with multiple offenses. We already have the information needed to take away their welfare so why not use it.,1
9,"I believe that Welfare is detrimental to the National Economy and does more harm to the recipients then good. People have become dependent on Welfare and unless they learn to fend for themselves, then they will always be on the streets begging. Overall Welfare is bad, not good and, well, you get the idea.",1
9,"I believe the Government should help people who really need it, but most of them keep having kids to get more money and so many have someone living with them and that person either has a job under the table or selling drugs. Also they should have to report somewhere everyday to be taught a trade so they will be able to take care of themselves",1
9,"I recently finished Edward Gibbons' ""The History of the Decline and the Fall of the Roman Empire,"" and I have to say that we're pretty much in a similar decline and fall.

9,"Although we can't starve babies, welfare moms can be stopped if anyone could come up with a viable plan. A real plan must be implemented as soon as possible, but no democrat is going to vote for it. Voters must come to their senses and elect republican representatives and senators or it will never be fixed. If we wait until welfare recipients outnumber self supporting citizens, it will be too late. A plan to eventually eliminate welfare moms can be found here",1
9,"I can only speak for my home state of NJ. Here many welfare recipients receive cash benefits, SNAP, Section 8, furniture vouchers, child care vouchers, and care insurance for $1 a day. What incentive do they have to work? Everything is basically being handed to them. I know there are plenty who aren't abusing the system. However, the ones who are make it bad for all. I say we abolish welfare altogether. Tired of the excuses about the so called bad economy, people need to get out their and look their are jobs out their. You may end up doing something you don't want to, but at least you're doing something. It is not the government's responsibility to take care of you if you are able bodied and of sound mind.",1
9,"Yes, gov't should end all welfare programs. (SNAP, Section 8, WIC etc) Most people are at those situations because they have made many poor choices in life. Of the few that actually deserves empathy, they can receive help through crowdfunding or non-profit organization can extend child sponsorship of third world country to family sponsorship in the US. This way everyone has a choice to help and support who they want.",1
9,"I am a pharmacist who gets to see just a very small part of how abuse the welfare system has become. While their are parts of our lives where we can use help, welfare has become a career option for many and is passed down through the generations only worsening our future.",1
9,"The real problem is that people are having children when they aren't supposed too. To raise a child properly it costs about $700 dollars a month. Dads in prison and moms on her sixth kid. She has no job, didn't graduate from high school and no work history so no one is going to hire her anyway. it's not a right to have children, it's a privilege for those that are economically viable. So if you want to get pregnant when your not, that's fine but not to live on our tax dollars.",1
9,"Millions of kids are being born cause they know free assistance is right around the corner. People have to learn to educate and defend themselves.

There's enough jobs for everyone but this world just keeps getting overpopulated with useless people.",1
9,"I believe the government should end welfare because it perpetuates dependency on the government for one's survival. People should learn to be self sufficient. I do think that if someone is seriously developmentally or physically disabled or has a debilitating disease and cannot work, they should get some from of help though. These are the people who truly need the help. I don't think that just because someone has a baby they should be eligible for welfare. If you cannot support your progeny, you have no business breeding in my opinion.",1
9,"there isn't enough regulations on who receives this money. People who work one or more jobs without assistance to survive are taxed to much. Tax the ones that are receiving the assistance and let them recycle the money. I have enough trouble keeping food on the table and the bills paid and it's not my neighbors issue it's mine, just like the stranger who just bought food with stamps and a 400.00 pool with cash that's their issue don't make it mine. Don't punish me because they can't monitor money.",1
9,"their should either be a 12 month limit per lifetime, on receiving welfare. If you can't get on your feet in 12 months then you need to find a family member who will take you in.

9,"If you are going to end all forms of government assistance then the child support system either needs and overhaul or need elimination. After all you have mentally and physically disabled who can't find stable work because of their illness and thus can't keep up on their forced payments and will wind up in jail as a result. Our jails will fill up with child support debtors faster than we can build and staff them. Er's will be used as primary care providers by those who can't afford medical insurance, quality of life crimes will skyrocket. Is this the world without welfare you want?",1
9,"Good hard-working people lose so much money in income tax which most of it goes to welfare programs. Most welfare recipients don't actually need the help or they don't even have a job. Welfare recipients usually have nicer things then hard-working people do because we are paying for those nice things. People who get welfare usually are not appreciative of it, may use it on drugs, and don't use it on education like college. Welfare creates dependency on government and will not solve poverty like a job and education would.",1
9,"When the lowest common denominator is who we, as a people, cater to, it brings our cities to a halt. The perfect example is Flint, Michigan. The once prosperous city that had a wonderful growing community has turned into a poor crime-filled slum. I believe when assistance is needed from the government, it should only be provided to people that are doing all the right things. If you reward bad behavior, the bad behavior flourishes. If I, as an employee, have to take a drug test, then anyone that is receiving assistance should also have to take a drug test, and show the attempt to further themselves as a citizen of this great country.",1
9,"You should not be allowed to vote if you don't pay taxes and collect assistances from the government. This election proves that entitlements don't work. If you want to be elected just buy the votes and to hell with the welfare of the country as a whole. I think that if you have not paid taxes (to include property taxes) in an election year and you're not of retirement age you should not be allowed to vote. If you're a drunk or addict the federal government will pay you to sit in your government subsidized apartment while eating xanax and drinking the free methadone provided by the government. NOW THAT’S BEING YOUR BROTHER'S KEEPER. I realize that some people do need welfare but when it becomes more profitable to stay home and collect a government checks then to work, it’s time for me to get in the welfare line. My work allows me to see first hand what the increase in welfare has don't to our country under President Obama. I observed a person causing disturbances on the local bus lines because the driver wouldn’t allow the welfare recipient on the bus with their 50 inch television which he bought with his welfare check. The welfare recipient is upset because he has a bus pass, which the government pays for, that entitles him to ride the bus for free but the driver wouldn't let him ride because of the size of the television. Eventually the police responded and locked him up for disorderly conduct. I asked this recipient of welfare if he thought it was ok for him to be spending he welfare money (my tax dollars) on this large flat screen television. He stated “why do you care it’s not your money”. Meanwhile the Federal Senators and Representatives are getting richer every day. In my state our elected officials are all millionaires, who by the way didn't start out that way. They will promise not to touch your Social Security but have no way to fund it and what’s more they don't care. The day will come before the end of this President's term that America will fall apart and most of us will have nothing but a dumb look on our faces and welfare check stubs in our pockets. ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS!",1
9,"Welfare, though good in some situations, is easily abused by many of those who use it. It gives people a reason to not try. The drive to work that once existed in this nation does not exist any longer. People need to get off their ass, and get to work in this country.",1
9,"When you pay people not to work, you are paying for their votes. it's that simple. The more people that are dependant on the government, the more power the government will have. We are now at a point where we have more ""takers"" than ""makers."" And that is disgusting. I took a job, where I make 1/3 of what I used to make because it was the right thing to do. Collecting a check for doing nothing or not taking a job that is ""beneath you"" is not acceptable. Again, this is about power and control. We will now have a ruling elite, that pretends to ""help the poor"" and/or ""for the working man"", that will control us all forever. Why you ask? Because you can never take away what others consider their ""entitlement."" Mike",1
9,"Too many people abuse the welfare system. An 18 year old with 3 kids and no education can get on welfare and stay on welfare of the remainder of her life. Welfare should go to those that need it, the disabled, the mentally handicapped, not someone who is just lazy. We need a better control process for food stamps, government financial aid, and public housing. I know many students who go to community college through federal aid, but they withdraw or fail the course but get to collect the student refund check. Some of these students will never complete a degree. While students who actually need it are left stranded.",1
9,"I have been a single mother on food stamps before. However, before I was on food stamps I worked and paid into taxes. And I only used food stamps for six months! I was off because I found a job! Now remarried my husband and I pay hundreds a month for welfare! These people that stay on consistently will never find a reason to get off of them!",1
9,"Welfare in it's current from doesn't work. It keeps the poor in their current state and does little to encourage their progression out of the welfare system. their are people in our society that legitimately need the assistance to survive. Those who truly cannot help themselves shouldn't be left to go without because others abuse the system. At a couple points in my life I have been on food assistance when I was temporarily out of work. However, even then it seemed what I got as ""assistance"" it was excessive. Currently I have a $60K per year income. That's a good ways away from poverty, but going to the grocery store to feed a family of three still stings. Yet when I was not working and single I was getting $300+ per month on a food card. Add that is tax free money too. Three hundred dollars buys a lot of food for one 150lb guy. And it buys the brand name food. But now when I am earning my own money my dollar doesn't go as far and I don't get to buy some of the luxury food items I could when I didn't work. While I was on the food card I was never told it would go away. I just had to come in every few months to sit in a room and update my case worker as to why I still needed the assistance. All I ever had to say was that I still was out of work. This could have gone on indefinitely and if I had no qualms about improving my life situation I could see how others get caught in the system. there's nothing to encourage those in the system capable of working to provide for themselves. We serious review of their circumstances that holds them in the system. They shouldn't be treated any differently then every other American. If it's common to have a drug test for me to get a job to earn a paycheck then it should carry over to those leaning on the government handouts to do the same. The amount of assistance should be lowered and their should be regulations regarding what the family can and can not purchase. Sugary fattening food is not sustenance. It creates another problem regarding poor health. If you cannot afford to feed yourself then I would assume you would need medical assistance as well. I won't go into the other issues with welfare like Section 8 housing, free cell phones, etc. Our government has created a lifestyle that is completely sustainable by just not working. It goes against the natural order of life. If you have to work to live. Socially we should care for those in need. But being in need should be a temporary thing.",1
9,"The entire system is a classic example of reverse racism. Now I don't know about where anyone else lives, but where I live the welfare system is refused to whites, regardless of need. For example my parents, both white are very hard working people, both have jobs, but due to extenuating circumstances are going broke and on top of that they've both depleted their 401 k accounts because they need money to fix the house and care. Yet every single time they have applied for welfare, they are told they make too much money, but the amount given for how much over the legal limit is only like $150.00 to $200.00 dollars. Now when I have talked to blacks or Mexicans on welfare, they say they only had to apply once to receive it, yet my parents have applied numerous times and been denied, mainly with this attitude of your white someone in your family is rich ask them for help, which is bullshit. Now for anyone reading this no one else in my family is or has ever been on welfare, and secondly the reason my parents need help is because of my sisters massive hospital bills relating to a rare genetic disease, which due to not making enough money to both pay off said bills and continue to support our family, they have had to apply for bankruptcy. If a system is designed to temporarily help people is going to be racist, one way or another it needs to be destroyed.",1

And then I will give you a couple bucks, because I know that you will need it!",1
9,"In its original intention welfare was to help those in need. I have no problem with helping those who are under privileged or in need of help for a short period of time. However, the system has been taken advantage of for too long. It seems that collecting welfare has become a way of life for some. Hell, welfare will even pay for a college degree and most who collect welfare don't go to school. I had to pay my way through college. I guess if I would have just quit my job and gone on welfare they would have paid it for me. I do believe in helping those who are less fortunate. That is why I believe in ""Workfare"". For those who are capable, I find no problem with making them work for the money. Can you imagine if all of the remedial jobs that our tax dollars pay for were workfare jobs instead. We would win two ways. Those on welfare who have to work for the monies may not stay on so long without being paid a high wage. Also, the tax dollars that would normally go to pay the high paying, remedial, ""government"" jobs would be back in our pockets.",1

9,"I agree with the people saying that welfare is a good idea. Closer monitoring is really all that is needed. It may be slightly invasive but that is a trade off. I agree that millions of people truly need some sort of income subsidy. their are people that state that illegals are taking the jobs THAT AMERICANS WON'T DO. I believe in subsidizing low income families but not paying people for nothing. Most American workers are paid for services provided not goods. When citizens used to barter they would trade goods, ie. Leather shoes for cow's milk. The other way would be paying for services with goods, ie. shelter and bread for tending to the crops. Now we trade printed money for goods and services. That being said, if you are not contributing to society (applies to able bodied citizens) by providing some sort of service or goods then what is the barter? You are taking from the collective community that is trying so hard to keep America out of extreme poverty. Welfare should be for subsidy. If you are able to work and decide not to then you have to live with those consequences. American Citizens should be working in the fields and construction and all of the other jobs that illegal immigrants are ""taking"" and then subsidized. This takes care of a large number of unemployed and gets rid of the ""money for nothing"" complaints.",1

I offered to take her grocery shopping and pay for her stuff myself, but she wouldn't hear of it. their I saw a large group of people who complained about how they wished they could have money like folks who worked. One lady was complaining that she couldn't afford anything for herself. That struck me as odd, because she had several LARGE tattoos on her body. Pulled out a smart phone repeatedly to text during our conversation. Chain smoked cigarettes, and was wearing a boatload of jewelry. I asked her why she couldn't afford stuff. I nearly fainted when she told me it was because the welfare people didn't give her enough discretionary spending money. Clearly she wasn't underfed - she had to be over 300 lbs. Her clothes were in current style. Her care was newer than mine. And the worse is she has leisure time - something I don't have and cannot buy, because I work two jobs. This has to stop.

Similar to the depression era CCC, the CCC of 2013 will be an answer to a problem. Creating better quality of life standards for all Americans including the 1%, needs to be recognized as a fundamental necessity. Currently the United States will be unable to implement permanent measures of economic, social or environmental sustainability due to lack of workforce however, current welfare statistics represent the numbers required to assemble a workforce similar to the CCC that is required to end the sustainability issues we are now faced with in 2013.

9,"I believe wholeheartedly that welfare should be ended in America for people who abuse it. Anyone who receives government help should get food ration stamps like in World War 2. That is the only help they should receive without having a job. When I go to the store, I see young people who have 2 and 3 babies using an EBT card. I look at them and think, ""I just paid for you to have all those babies and provide food for them. You need to get a job and not have so many babies."" We need to limit the amount of children families can have like in China. I also think that by giving people welfare we are enabling them to stay home and get free money from the government. I did not say that the government can take my hard earned money to pay for people who are lazy and don't work. I am tired of it. If we all refused to pay for welfare, what then? Can all working Americans go to jail? I think not! It is time that we stick up for our rights as working Americans and say no more welfare taxes. I am tired of working 60 hours a week due to the economic crisis and just barely getting by myself but I can't get help because I make too much to qualify for welfare. It keeps people dependent upon living without getting at least a minimum wage job. People are lazy and don't want to work. End welfare now. People who get it will find out what working is all about.

We are not supposed to reward sourness and laziness! Where did we go wrong with this? I believe in taking care of those that are elderly and physically unable to work.

9,"Welfare is being handed out to illegals, in my state, you can be illegal, make $4,000 a week and still obtain the full amount of state benefits, cash, food, medical. Illegals don't make legal money and therefore, don't have any income, so we give them a check and some food every month and then complain about them being here. I don't have a problem helping out the elderly or the disabled that have either been disabled all their adult life or have been paying in to the system right up until they are disabled. I don't even have a problem helping out their caretakers. I don't have a problem helping someone out that has fallen on hard times temporarily and is trying to get back on their feet. I do have a problem with people that are fully capable of obtaining work, sitting around collecting a check and doing nothing to improve their lives. If you get on welfare and have a baby, they don't make you look for a job for the first year, I'm pretty sure I went back to work within 6 weeks. Why is it that if you have a job, you get a month, two at best, but if you don't you get all the time in the world? If we would make welfare temporary, require random drug testing (I had to get drug tested to work) and stop giving illegal immigrants benefits their would be a huge change in our budget. If a new program was created for unemployment, the elderly and for disabled persons only then we would truly be helping out those who needed and we would not be enabling those who take advantage.",1

9,"Roughly 100 million people (one third of the United States population) received aid from at least one means--tested welfare program each month. That is ridiculous. Under Obama's budget plans, welfare spending would continue to grow in the next decade, reaching $1.56 trillion by 2022. In my opinion this is way too much $$ to be spending on those who cannot carry a job and support their family. If we eliminated the entire social welfare system it would force individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market, must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap.",1
9,"When I see people younger and in better physical condition then myself essentially getting paid to stay home, I get really upset. Welfare was never envisioned as a lifelong subsidy of those who can but will not work. I must unwillingly hand over a large amount of my paycheck to people who have something no amount of money can buy for me - leisure. I in return get absolutely nothing back from them. One would have thought that the 14th amendment would have effectively ended involuntary servitude, but I am enslaved in part to the indolent and irresponsible. Granted, their are some elderly and some truly infirm folks who need assistance, but that is where it should end; assistance, not a free ride.",1
9,Welfare was meant as a helping hand but it has become a way of life for many and ending it or drastically reducing benefits would save our country billions. I recently had the opportunity to go to our local social service building. Imagine my shock when I realized that illegal immigrants are allowed to apply for assistance because they are in our country and gave birth. Who is allowing assistance to non citizens? Take away the freebies and make people stand on their own two feet. It might even help improve our immigration problem.,1

9,"While welfare programs were designed and implemented as a temporary assistance for the people that need it to get back on their feet, it has turned into a long-term income for the leeches of our society today. Reform would be acceptable if it was not doomed to failure all over again. The loop- holes that have been found in the current system would be found all too quickly in a revised system. Welfare is a fine idea, but the damage to our economy far outweighs the benefits to its beneficiaries. It is my opinion that money collected from working people and handed out to the undeserving would be put to far better use by the worker then the leech. It is unfortunate that good people who use the program as intended would be hurt by this but something has to be don't.",1
9,"Over 150 years ago people came to this country with the idea of a better life. Today people come here for their welfare check and food stamps, and have ten kids for the sake of more money from the US government which comes from the taxpayer. I WORK very hard to give my family a good living and put money away for retirement, but when you see someone getting a free ride from the government it makes you feel like a sucker. To reform welfare will mean for a while it would save money until people figure out how to abuse the system again. This is why it must go. Let's not forget the people who work off the books and get a handout. The system must go. I could write all day why it must go and not come up with one reason why we should keep it. This is why the middle class get poorer because taxes get raised to support lazy people.",1
9,"Welfare is how the poor receives financial aid. In the United States, the welfare system arose during the Great Depression. These living benefits included general and special payments for certain circumstances, food stamps, Medicaid health care and housing benefits. During the period, welfare was initially saw as a right. This caused people to believe that states had limitless welfare funds from the federal government. As a result, states did not have any incentive to encourage people to get off welfare. Then, Congress passed the ""Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act"" so the states obtained the control of welfare. The states still have to adhere to basic requirements. The welfare debate is now in full swing in especially the United States. The fact that numerous requirements must be in place has been criticized as being unnecessary. This is because with such a welfare function, work requirements is possible and might be an optimal solution, however, the effectiveness of such work requirements depends on the accuracy of the screening mechanism which assigns work requirements. Personally, if some poor fellow comes up to me in the street and asks me for some money to help feed him and his family, I might be moved with compassion and want to help. I would reach in my pocket to see if I have any money so I could help him. The least I could do is give him a few bucks. But maybe I don't have the means or interest in helping out this fellow. Is it okay for me to go to another fellow, force a few dollars out of them and give it to him? No, it’s not. That is theft. Perhaps a theft with well intentions, but still theft. Also, if there are children that cannot survive even with the parents they have, can they not just go to a foster or adoption home? their, they can be cared for and loved appropriately. there would be no need for welfare. Plus, others say that if parents can't take care of their children properly, they need welfare to help them. But if the parents already knew that they would not be able to take care of their children, why would they have children in the first place? My third and last reason is that welfare is not helping America overall. It is raising taxes for the wealthier, and is not lowering the amount of homelessness. The employment rates are still going down, too. their are 4.3 million people in just America with welfare, and that number is bound to go up in later years. The government is already spending 131.9 billion dollars a year on welfare, and the economy is already not doing too well. Overall, welfare is not necessary and should be banned in the United States.",1
9,"Recent stats- 15% of Americans on food stamps. Many urban school systems provide free breakfast and lunch-why? how much do these people need to eat? It should be MINIMAL, not over indulgence. Sick. Section 8 is out of control. Find something cheaper, co-habituate. Why do these welfare people even have expensive phones or large TV's with huge cable packages? Why can they afford this? Why are such a large percent of welfare recipients such terrible parents and raise so many school dropouts? Support should be limited to two years of anyone's life, support for children mandatory cut off at two (personally, one should be the cut off). In Japan, their are concrete little block type apartments by the airport. Anyone on assistance lives their-the only choice for the most part. The utilities are hooked up, moderate kitchen facilities and that is it. If the want food, they must go out and work or it is not provided. This was my understanding of the system from Japanese people who explained it to me in the 80's- it may be much different now. I was raised in poverty- I worked 70 to 90 hours a week as a waitress from age 14 onward. I eventually got out of that work, but it was MANY years and very hard. If it was good enough for me to cut onions for hours, work like a slave and always pay my own way, it is good enough for you. I never had children as I knew I could not provide for them. I resent every penny paid to people on welfare. For every success story, their will be thousands more of failure, drop-outs, system abuse, act. 2 Years over a lifetime. If you cannot figure out how to hold a job and live indoors in two years, perhaps you will have relatives that will cry at your funeral. Remember- it was good enough for me- I have NO EMPATHY. We DO need to pay the senior citizens their SS, they earned it. It was not my frickin idea to send so much money to the government for my supposed retirement fund. Either give me back every damn penny ...I will happily sign any paper saying if I am ever in need they may exterminate me rather than help me, or pay the SS in the future. It is a self-funding system, President Clinton left that system with a huge surplus, by simply NOT spending it on anything other then the intended benefits. I am not of age to collect SS, and I have never collected a dime of assistance in my life with almost no education, a terribly abusive poverty stricken home. I rose above it and own a business today. Get off your butt and take responsibility for yourself. If you refuse to do the minimum wage work I did to survive, then go ahead and starve. No one will care.",1

9,"Welfare recipients are destroying themselves and simply are educated enough to realize it. They weren't taught self pride or self reliance because the schools fed their stomach and not their mind. The welfare system in America is vicious to those who accept a check. It is designed to keep them suppressed easily controlled. If a person is never taught accepting welfare is giving up your success and freedom then they blindly accept their fate. Individuals that expect our government to change in order to fix the problem are not helping. An easy way to help the uneducated welfare recipient is simple. Say you are having a conversation about financial difficulties and the other person begins a speech about how to get a check from the government, you must talk to them about what they are sacrificing. Talk to them about self pride because if they are openly bragging about accepting welfare they have not been taught morals or self reliance. They seem to have pride and shame confused. If you aren't earning it yourself then it is shameful to brag about it but they seem to take pride in ""getting government money"". Explain to them how they have just embarrassed themselves but doing this. Help them understand the cycle of control, how their choice to accept welfare is destroying their future and their children's future. One person at a time that how real change occurs.",1

Even after my grandfather bought a tractor in 1929, he kept old man Anderson working the mules until Anderson died. That was true welfare. And there were no ridiculous medical bills. People just grew old and died. You and I will die, so why financially destroy America in the process?",1
9,The current Welfare system is corrupt and one in which women have babies just to live off the system. Those children are born into poverty by ill equipped mothers. The cycle never ends. You should be taxed in this country for every child. That will stop unwanted babies. If you can not afford them then keep your legs closed!,1

9,"Welfare should be a temporary fix for people that need help. It should not be a way of life. Food stamps should only be for people on low income, not for people that live with a person that makes over $15.00 an hour. It is so wrong that when a working person needs temporary help they can't get anything. But if a person chooses not to work, they get all the benefits that government provides. My daughter was off work for 2 months due to surgery. She was not able to get any kind of temporary help because her boyfriend lives with her. But I have a family member that has lived with her boyfriend for over 20 years and she still gets Medicaid and food stamps. She uses her food stamps to buy groceries for her daughter because her daughter isn't eligible and my sister doesn't need them. What's wrong with this system?",1
9,"I grew up in a family of uneducated parents that always made bad decisions, they were lazy and chose to make excuses blaming everyone else for their problems. Every family in our trailer park had the same story, all using welfare to live because they could get by on it without having to go out and work for it. They all sat at home watching TV, doing drugs, drank alcohol, smoked cartons of cigarettes, and this was their whole life, and still do to this day. I am so sick of hearing about all these ""single moms"" who can't support their kids. When are people going to grow up and accept responsibility for their choices and actions. If you aren't financially able to take care of yourself, what business do you have bringing life into this world. How dare these people expect me and all of the other people who earn their way in life to pick up the check. I hope the handouts end, the only way to end laziness is to force an end.",1

I'm sure most of the people out their, currently receiving benefits, could find some from of work in that amount of time. Maybe they could set up a program where you receive benefits for working an assigned job.

If someone could get nearly as much money claiming welfare as working, there would be no motivation to work. What would eventually happen is that America would have more people claiming welfare then people working. Is this a world you want to live in?

Not to mention a major contribution to the debt crisis, the fed is just printing away which only hurts the poor even more through inflation and price manipulation.

The role of government is not that of God. I end with this. I believe it was Thomas Jefferson who said this in a letter but, ""To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone of a free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it.""",1

She can't afford them but continues to have them and continues to collect food stamps and assistance from the government so that she can stay at home with her kids and increase the size of her family. How nice of a life it must be for someone to live off someone else's taxes. Welfare should be EARNED, not handed out. A person who is shameful of receiving welfare is DESERVING in my eyes. A person who EXPECTS welfare and is NOT ashamed at all for collecting it, is NOT deserving in my eyes. She is a perfectly capable woman, she could work if she wanted to, but she chooses not to because it's easier. As for people who have disabilities, there are tons of work programs for people with disabilities - they should enroll in one as part of requirement to receive some from of welfare. Blind people, or people with physical disabilities are welcomed and the employers work with the employee to overcome the disability so there really is NO EXCUSE. People should be REQUIRED to pay what they've received in benefits once they get back on their feet, no exceptions.

I also know more than 5 women who have their boyfriend, significant other living with them, but say they have no support and receive benefits. I know a woman who will NOT marry her boyfriend because she gets benefits from the state for her children( his kids) that she would NOT receive if she was not a single mother. I know one woman who has 5 kids with three different dads. She lives in her brother's house and he has a great job but she still collects all the assistance she can get, and even though she already has 5 kids in the system she is considering having another with another guy...And somehow she received a tax return...How that happens is beyond me as she hasn't worked in ten years. I know that just the fact that I know these types of people seems odd, but these are people you see every day in America. The system is made to be taken advantage of and working class America is getting screwed by its own. I work every day. My husband works every day. We are not making less money for the same amount of work just to fund this type of behavior. Sometimes, I think maybe I will quit and just collect instead.",1

9,"Simply put, no one, no matter how great their need, has a right to the earnings or property of others. And consequently, the enforced redistribution of it is immoral and I would argue that no government has a legitimate role as a collector for charity by force. What's more, there is no general obligation to provide for anyone. I have a duty to provide for my family. I might assume an obligation to provide for certain others if I choose. But, Only if I choose. If one is moved to assume a general obligation, out of religious convictions or what have you, they have every right to contribute as much as they want to a voluntary charitable effort. I have an equal right to choose not to do this. Welfare is enforced charity. But no one's need, no matter how great, confers a right to have what is legitimately someone else's. In no way do I deny that their are those who legitimately need help and even deserve it. To help these, I do encourage private voluntary charity, and I practice it. But that is a voluntary choice. It is also discriminatory -- it does discriminate in favor of the truly deserving not just those who want the largess. I think that about a century of experience has shown us that government welfare both encourages and breeds dependency (which politicians encourage and exploit as a political tool) and undermines the basic social connections and social fabric that, in the past, served to make a more cohesive society. Wonder why modern society is so fragmented and tattered? Take a hard look at how many things that used to be don't by private citizens looking out for each other and the deserving needy that have been taken over and supplanted by the cold hand of bureaucratic government.",1

Welfare programs should not be used because the middle class is paying for the program with their tax money, the system is being abused, and many people are unhappy about being on welfare. First of all, welfare is being paid by the tax of the middle class people. “Food stamps are an example of a welfare program set up by the government, in order to help the poor. The budget from food stamps comes from the middle class taxpayers,” says the Pro’s and Con’s of Welfare article. Not everyone has the choice whether or not to be on welfare. Those who would not like to be on the program should be taken off, so that the tax money spent on welfare could be reduced and put to better use. This is just one of many reasons that the welfare programs should be removed. Also, the welfare program is used by people all over the United States, those who use the program for good and the others who abuse the system. In some cases, their are legitimate causes for those who are on welfare. Yet, their are some who abuse the system and acquire more than they should. People abuse the system that wastes hard-earned tax money. It is assumed that people who are on welfare programs are trying to claim more than they need, in order, to avoid looking for a job. This is yet another reason as to why welfare programs should not exist. Finally, many of the people who are on the program are unhappy about being on welfare. Most people would rather not be put on welfare. This is because the program has been labeled with a bad name; however, some people don't have a choice. The reality of the program is that people are unhappy about having to rely on these programs to survive. The individuals who abuse the system give the innocent people who really need welfare, a bad name. This is why welfare programs should not be provided. In conclusion, welfare programs should be excluded from our society. Three reasons as to why there should no longer be any welfare programs are because the middle class is using their hard-earned tax money to pay for welfare, the system is being abused, and many people are unhappy about being on the program. Welfare programs should no longer be included in today’s society.",1
9,this country is falling apart and becoming no better than mexico or any other of the central american countries...because all the immigrants are coming here and working the system to live for free. as an educated woman who has worked her way up-by working part time jobs and educating myself and even learning a foreign language it burns me up to see all these immigrants living off the system-i have sacrificed and while they are living it up...the old timers who fought for this country would be disgusted. gotta wonder if they would have such a life in their own countries of origin or would even go to the lengths that the true americans do to keep build this country.,1
9,"I already support my family (this includes my grandparents too) and I don't understand why I have to support others who don't have a job or are even willing to work.

9,"people want to have 4-5 kids and have no plan on how to raise them. it's just an excuse when they say they need money. it's not the government's duty to take care of all those kids. thousands of kids are born so does that mean government should spend their money to take care of someone's responsibility? the parents should plan their future ahead before saying kids need welfare. people are messed up, don't want to work but have kids with everyone. if people are hardworking they can afford it. people wanting welfare are the people who don't deserve it because they are responsible for their own situation. thousands of immigrants come and work and still manage to live without welfare but some people just want free money. thats crazy.",1
9,"My wife and I go into a store to shop and use our own money from our pensions. A large percentage of people I see are using government access cards, and most have never worked a job in their lives. Is this fair treatment for the taxpayers in this country? HELL NO!",1
9,"The majority of people taking advantage of the welfare program have been receiving benefits from us for generations, and the very small percentage that actually need assistance, but the government doesn't care, the more they give out, the more votes they can get. why isn't there a cap to what a family or person can get?!!!",1
9,I'm tired of paying for lazy people! I worked all my life. How dare them take the free ride! Maybe they should see some people in other countries where they are starving. They should to know how good it is to live in America and not somewhere else. They need to understand working is what makes this country great!,1
9,"Tired of taking care of those who don't want to take care of themselves. They expect others to take care of everything for them so they don't have to do anything. They keep having more children, buying drugs and such with any handout. I have to work for a living to take care of my family, my spouse pays child support and such for his son. Yet others still expect everything to be free to them. When do I get something for free?? I don't!!",1
9,"It is not my job to support people who don't want to work, and just want someone else to take care of them. If they are ""responsible"" enough to have a child, they are responsible enough to take care of that child or they had better learn to be responsible. I am also tired of them claiming welfare and using that money to buy alcohol and drugs. If I have to take a drug test for my job, they should have to take one for any government assistance they are receiving. I am tired of giving my tax dollars to people who don't want to earn it. I believe there are some who legitimately deserve assistance, if someone lost a job and can't find a new one, or someone who is legitimately disabled. But otherwise, people need to take care of themselves and their own families. If any from of welfare should continue, volunteer work should accompany it. their is trash on the sides of the roads and such. Parks need maintenance. They should have to work to earn their money.",1
9,"As someone working full time, I think that my tax money should be put to better use. I see people all the time that misuse the help that they are receiving, I think this encourages people not to work, and to keep reproducing since they get more out of it. I'm sure that their are people out their that legitimately need the help, but I think there are far more that abuse it. Something needs to change!",1
9,The more we keep up lazy Americans is the more we spend in federal taxes. yes some need it but a majority don't look at some other countries and see how prosperous their economies are and they don't have any government aid programs. It kills me to see this abuse in the system,1
9,"Instead of handing out free welfare money to individuals, use this government funding to open welfare day cares, food markets, schools, housing apartments, prison systems, rehabilitation centers,farms to produce food, clothing shops, and any other MUST HAVE support systems the welfare community needs to survive. Mandate the people of the welfare community to run their own world. Teach them the skills needed in their own school systems. Give them jobs with in their communities and if they fail after being handed everything they need to succeed, then cut their benefits. Forcing the welfare community to support themselves with the government as their mentor would make the United States stronger than ever. Well off Americans would be proud and willing to give donations to the less fortunate to help them better themselves. Wake up US Politicians and lets make some real changes!",1
9,Everyone should work and pay for their own children it's not right that the working class can't afford any children but welfare recipients care afford as man kids as they want the working class Heros of today are supporting kids when they themselves can't have any that is unfair and unjust and it needs to be stopped,1
9,"Why do people on welfare keep reproducing? I work a full time job, as does my wife. I served four tours in support of OEF and OIF. Yes I am stressed out to pay the bills to feed my child. Yes I could get free money for disability from the military, but I would never. I earn mine, as did my ancestors. Great idea to give the uneducated/lazy free money and supplement them more money for reproducing. Apples don't fall far from the trees, right? If so, America is just breeding out the hard working families.",1
9,"I am a Republican and I am proud of it (so take my opinion out of account if you're a radical politician), needless to say, I believe that welfare should be abolished. I do understand that their are a few people who truly do deserve it and do need it, but their are always the rats that ruin the system. Those rats come up in stories so often that it seems like the only use of welfare is defeated because of its abuse! The people who are in the ""lower class"" need to get off their supposedly lazy arses and get to work! Working for yourself is better then working for someone else. And don't pull this Liberal ""feel good"" crap on me, it doesn't work. If you want to ""feel good"", make someone do work for you so you can pay them and make them feel better about themselves so they can build a business and help themselves. Liberty and justice for all.",1
9,"Yes they should end the welfare that is in place today and rebuild it with less, more tighter timelines of people needing to work if they are receiving it. The government to make a person work minimum wages if they live in government funded housing, and monitor who lives in the housing complex w/ a weekly inspection.",1
9,"I know far to many people that are healthy bodied people and yet are able to get government handouts. Me being a small business worker, the toughest part I have is finding someone that's willing to work!! My response to that is, go kill something , drag it home, and eat it like the rest of us and quit biting the hand that really feeds you!",1
9,"I believe the United States should end welfare because it makes people stupid and lazy.They have no self-worth but they feel they are getting over.They don't have any knowledge of where the money comes from.They say the government owes me.No not one person owes anyone anything.This will force the father's to pay for their children,Both parent need to be supportive mentally, emotionally and physically and financially.This is your child or children no one else's.I have to be responsible for myself and my bills and so should they. I only feel the people who are critically ill or the elderly should get help for the government, I have no problem with that",1
9,"When the number of people on welfare exceeds the number of people that work and pay taxes then the makers will become slaves to the takers. there is no good explanation for the government welfare system. Taxpayers work hard for their money and they should have the say for what their paying for, not politicians trying to buy votes. If you feel the need to take care of people that don't want to work, then give money to a charity.",1
9,I believe in helping the needy. But there's too much corruption and theft and no personal responsibility whatsoever. People need to start being accountable or at least helping the community by community service and other things. Because the money is not free. Also people that are able to work should work but don't because the law is not hard on them. This country is not growing and won't if people think they have a backup. They never will get out of the welfare cycle if this isn't stopped. it's not helping the poor it's just keeping them in it.,1
9,"Too many people on welfare stay on it only because they can, not because they have no other choice. Let the system work for people that have lost their jobs to massive layoffs, etc. But the system needs major limitations and time frames... I'm tired of paying my taxes so ignorant lazy people can stand in line for their ""Obama money"" especially when most of those people have no idea where the money comes from.",1
9,"Gang bangers are poor and dumb out of laziness to learn and work hard. Why should other people put up with them and the cost to our society. If they decide to commit crimes, then we'll start hanging them all. If a woman wants to get pregnant and expect someone else support, then that's her choice. But, it should not be not my choice to work hard for my bills and dreams and have the government take 40%of my income. I'm tired.",1
9,"there are too many excuses for lazy people and people who choose drugs and alcohol over life. Stop using the excuse that ""through no fault of their own"". That is a lie. When I was out being selfish, I lived off others, but when I took responsibility for my own actions, I learned to work and save. If people choose not to work or be lazy then they need to starve. Through starvation they will either learn or die. How interesting that we live in a society of free choice but people are not free to choose laziness without being rewarded. Why aren't we rewarded for crime, oops, yes we are. We receive a place to stay, food to eat and the ability to become more educated criminals. What kind of society do we live in that hard work is seen as evil and laziness is seen as good. We are a welfare society because the men and women of our country don't have the guts to accept the truth. The truth is that their are too many lazy asses, illegals, drug dealers and criminals in our country. As long as these individuals are present in our society, our finances will continue to dwindle.",1
9,"Leave it up to local communities to help the needy. there are plenty of people and places out their that would take up this ""Cross"" and keep our citizens fed and sheltered. It isn't the government's job to feed, clothe, and shelter the people. People need to be responsible for themselves. there is no reason I should have to pay for an alcoholics food because he has an addiction he caused himself. there is no reason I should have to pay for a drug addicts shelter because he wants to get high. This world has a screwed up view of what the responsibility of government is.",1
9,"I am from an area where there are several generations that have been living on welfare, and it is just a way of life. Here, they have a government provided cell phone and a card that they can use for food at a grocery store and get money back (as you would use a debit card). Can we stop this? No, because these people have no idea how to take care of themselves, and they are living on that check from the government. 47% that Romney said that was living on our taxes? I see it, every day. Cut if off, and we will be like Greece, with riots, etc. Just saying.",1
9,"Yes some people need help, we should share our cheddar to get these few though the hard times, but most are human debris, unwilling to work and share the responsibility of citizenship and pay taxes. I deal with these folks everyday, their is nothing wrong with them, just lead-butted. Lifetime $ limits would help, Or maybe make welfare a loan, with some % of repay expected or military or public service required.",1
9,"Let me point out that the only legitimate purpose for government is to defend life, liberty, and property. The government is supposed to help provide a way for people to defend themselves against theft. Those who are working are having money stolen from them and given to those who are collecting welfare money. Now if I were to ask you to strong arm your neighbor to steal their property/money to only to give it to me then I am just as guilty of theft as you are. Those who are collecting welfare are collecting money that has been stolen from those who have earned it. During the Cold War we detested the USSR for being socialist/communist and yet welfare is part of socialism and communism.",1
9,"Why should a hard working American have to pay taxes for lazy person to sit their and abuse system? it's not a matter of fairness, but justice. They should be out looking for jobs, not sitting on their bottoms waiting for a check. Rewarding bad behavior with money? Seems logical.",1
9,They should give whomever is on welfare a job to do in the community to be eligible to receive the welfare check... People need to be accountable! Why should we pay for others to sit at home?? If your on welfare I feel you need to go out and do something to earn the money you are being given,1
9,"their might be people who genuinely need welfare, but more and more I see cases of sheer abuse of welfare. When teenagers are getting free school and high school education, there should be no reason why they cannot finish their high school and get a job. But instead what I see is more people are lazy, have kids and then depend on welfare even before they turn 15. They believe that it is the government's responsibility to take care of them.",1
9,"As I walk around downtown today, I can easily find 2-3 different places with signs on the door saying ""Help Wanted."" Well, just because people don't want to work a crap job or even a couple of jobs at one time, then why do I have to support their laziness? America is getting too lazy and those who are hard working are the ones paying the burden left by those who don't care",1
9,"I would be ashamed to be on welfare. I work any job I can get to pay my bills. I don't buy houses I can't afford or live beyond my means in any way. Why is anyone entitled to a free ride or government assistance? I grew up poor and we never used government assistance, we just did without. My husband and I work hard for everything we have. We saved for years so in the future we could pay our daughter's tuition. We also knew we could not afford more children. The welfare program in running unchecked and there are far more people abusing the system then actually need it. Cut it off, start from scratch and keep it in check. And deport all illegals.",1
9,"I agree that the United States government should end welfare because far too many people abuse the system. their are a lot of people that could work and are healthy but choose not to because it's easier for them to just collect free money. It is a burden on the taxpayers and is not fair for people to get free money. If welfare was no longer, people would be forced to work or support themselves in other ways instead of depending on the government I33 Jess said it very well. It is ridiculous how many people abuse the welfare system when they should be out their working as much as they need in order to support themselves and their family. If you have to take 3 jobs, you do it; You don't sit back and collect a check b/c you can't find the perfect job.",1
9,"It is sad to admit, but I feel that the US should get rid of welfare. there are way too many people who abuse the system. They prefer to be let go from work so that they can get paid to sit on their behind. It is said that the hard working class has to carry those people. I understand that their are ones who deserve and need it, but the US is not equipped to verify who does or does not deserve it.",1
9,"Welfare is for emergency times in one's life but their appear to be many out their adapting to years on the welfare system when they are more than capable of earning some money. I am a single mum with 2 children working 50 hours a week to support my children. At one stage I was studying full time whilst working full time to try and improve my earnings prospect. Life has not been easy. I get really annoyed when people are happy to spend 30, 40 years, even a lifetime on the welfare system when there is no physical or mental reason why they should not be working or studying. It is about time those on welfare, if able, put back into the community. I know some do.their are genuine people who cannot work and must rely on the welfare system. But for those who can work, if they are unable to find a job, they should put back into the community and at least volunteer their time on a weekly basis. We need to get rid of this mental attitude where people think they are 'entitled' to certain handouts from the government,funded by my hard earned dollars in the from of tax!",1
9,"Because people are becoming parasites and leeching off the system, it should be abolished. Why should I pay taxes to give a lazy slob a paycheck for purposely not working? Welfare creates debt and we pay for it and don't get anything from it in return. If welfare is abolished it creates more wealth, a better economy with less poverty.",1
9,"Welfare robs people of self confidence... the less you work, the more you earn. it's not fair. If you aren't making enough money, get your first/another job. If you can't afford a kid, don't have one. Stop abusing the money we work hard to make. Anyone who can get off the couch to go apply for welfare can get up and earn their own money.",1
9,"Any time you give somebody something for free they become dependent on it. People in this country are lazy and have no drive to do anything on their own. No one has anyone to blame for the situations they're in but themselves. The government can't make you go back to school or work harder or get a second job to pay for things you want. Quit being a leach and do things for yourself. It used to be shameful to take handouts, now it's a lifestyle. America is a joke now. Don't have ambition to succeed because you've always got the safety of welfare to save you.",1
9,"Parents needs to start taking responsibility for their own children not the taxpayers. If a person wants to have children make sure you can support them and quit whining about it. As a single individual I took the road of not having any children since I couldn't afford them and had enough decency not to expect a handout, If someone needs assistance for 1 yr I would understand that long as there is a drug test, agreement for birth control, no drinking, gambling, or drugs. A single taxpayer without dependent(s) ends up just barely making a living and does not qualify for any support if they become ill or unable to work yet they have to pay taxes to support someone that will get better benefits and pay then themselves. The only thing the taxpayer gets is their pride of knowing they tried.",1
9,"Welfare should be for only one year after a year you are don't and will not be able to apply again. I am tired of seeing people on welfare eat better then I do. Dress better than I do and receive medical assistance. I see them buy the best cut of steak, and crab legs while I buy hamburger then after they pay for it with their food stamps they pay cash for their beer and cigarettes. Come on if you have the money for the beer then stop smoking and buy your own food. And no more giving welfare to people from other countries who come here. If you cannot support yourself then you cannot come into the country. I am tired of paying for everyone. Get a job and if one is not enough get another one. Years ago extended families lived together grandma stayed home and watched the kids while everyone else went to work and pooled their money. Everyone lived well. Maybe it's time to get back to that.",1
9,"I'm tired of the government taking food off my table to give to others who refuse to work, and there are tons of people on welfare that can work but are just too lazy. I need to eat too! I don't make much but at least I have a job. I'm tired of seeing people at the grocery store buying full carts of steaks and cokes and candy on my dime when I can't afford it because I am paying for them to eat like that!",1
9,"I know that not everyone on Welfare are drug users, lazy, and unmotivated. But if the government continues to reward people for making stupid decisions then it will only lead to more people getting on welfare. Yes their are the people that need it to take care of their kids while they work full time and go to school, but whose fault was it that you laid down and had those kids before you were able to afford it. It wasn't the taxpayers fault so why should the taxpayers have to pay for your mistakes. If you can't afford kids then don't have them. Simple as that. Use some money to get on birth control if you can't refrain from having sex. If the government ended welfare then it will not only force current recipients to get out and get a job but it will also teach responsibility and hard work to future generations. If people see that they don't have government assistance to rely on ever then they will know what they need to do to not starve and to survive. And their children will also make smarter decisions to survive also. Cutting welfare in a way will eventually lead to a smarter America and a better economy.",1
9,"It is not responsible to pay for others because they probably didn't spend the time to study and know they regret it so they need aid. Also paying for others will just collapse our government people won't find jobs and get money from the government, like Europe. Rich people don't want to continue their jobs and the poor just get money from European government.",1
9,It is not my responsibility to pay for others poor planning of their lives. I see people of all races sucking the life out of others like myself. Get a job! If you can't afford children have some morals and don't have sex. Choose a spouse that's a decent person not a sexy thug you think is hot.,1
9,Welfare creates slaves. People are born on this system and learn to live this way. The ethics of working for what you receive is lost in this system. I was born to parents that were married at 16 years old and lived very limited income. They took care of us with a very limited budget and taught us to work for what we get. We never participated in the welfare program as my parents were too proud. Both parents finished high school and worked low skilled jobs. I joined the Army at 17 and earned a GI bill for collage. I now make 120K per year and my wife make 20K a year. Our girls don’t know the struggles we grew up on but they are taught that they need to earn to receive. No one owes them anything. This basic lesson will keep them in them in the hunt for improving their skills and serving others to receive monetary rewards. (Money) Sometimes this is a hard lesson but it is vital to being free. Don't depend on a hand out and you will be in control of your destiny. Welfare takes what others earn and gives to those that do nothing. An example I like to ask kids in school…..You worked hard and make straight A’s and your friend does not work as hard makes D’s…..at the end of the grading period you give some of your grades to your friend and together you both make a C+. Is that fair? Most would say no as the friend did not earn the grade. A system that takes from those do and give to those that don't will fail at some point. Remove welfare and other hand out systems and people will go to work. This will also help resolve our nation’s budget issues. Another effect from reducing handouts will reduce the immigration inrush as their will be less incentive for people to come here.,1
9,"I'd argue it depends mostly on background history. - A mother who's recently divorced with one child, and trying to attend college, deserves some assistance (I can relate). - A mother who's had three husbands, 3 or more children, and has no high school education will be nothing but a waste of tax money. it's got a grey line, but I believe welfare should end in the United States. This is biased, though, seeing as I am NOT on welfare. I do however have some experience, as my mother was when I was child. She saved money, went to college, and is no longer on welfare and has a stable job in the medical field.",1
9,"It is not sustainable and rewards bad, or rather, maladaptive behavior. And furthermore, it takes freedom away from many citizens who are required to give their earnings to an inefficient government to squander.

At the very least the government could put the money towards education (of all socioeconomic classes) instead of entitlement programs.",1
9,because people abuse the money that we work for. They also take advantage of the requirements of getting it and then start expecting to receive money without working for it.

9,"I have been working in the service industry for over 34 years in many demographic markets observing many abuses of the Assistance Programs. All elected appointed individuals should spend perhaps 5 hours or so a few times a year in the service field to see firsthand the results of their decision making to remind themselves how their decisions impact folks from every walk of life. Over my 34 working years I remember placing $300 plus of groceries in the trunk of a full size Cadillac whose owner shopped weekly paid for in paper Food Stamps/late 1970's. I apprehended folks stealing merchandise alcohol baby formula from my retail stores that I managed to trade for drugs. I spoke with the captain of the local police dept. When in prior months these same thieves would shop for groceries again pay for with paper Food Stamps.

One mother I asked, why don't you work? Her reply, I would lose my welfare. Wow! I find this disgusting, and no one can realize the value of things if they are handed everything for free. I'm over it, it's unfortunate for those who use it as a stepping stone but too many become lifelong recipients and breed future lifelong recipients. It needs to stop. Charities should help those who Truly need it and may be supported by those who ""want"" to give, not by force through taxes. People need to take responsibility for their own lives and be held accountable for their actions or inaction.

However, the system is abused today by losers for years on out. I've been to many of welfare houses. They have flat screens, entertainment systems and more expensive things. I also knew a man once, middle-class, who lost his job. Instead of leaving his 2400/month apartment to find a cheaper one, he lived their for 2 years until he ran out of cash. He wasn't able to find a job, so he got on welfare. He has been on welfare since '08 and has no need to leave because the government pays for him will he sits on the couch.

My mom and dad worked very hard to provide for my siblings and I and now we find out that if we had been on government welfare the whole time we could have just coasted through life. My mom was a CPS investigator so she worked with a lot of people on welfare. Often they had more than we did. If a person is on welfare, they don't have to work like the rest of us. We grow up, work hard, and get good jobs only for the government to take that money away and give it to someone who slacked off in school and didn't work for what they get.",1
9,"I am supportive of children in need having proper medical care, but watching families eat better then mine everyday, while my husband works two jobs to care for our family, disgusts me. Cell phones are a luxury item. If you can't afford food, you can't afford a cell phone. I would rather my tax dollars pay for a bank of phones at a government office that pay for someone's phone so that they can text and post on Facebook. The poor in this country are richer than those working their asses off - they get free housing and utilities, clothing vouchers, school lunches, free food to eat better then I do, and in some places free transportation, now cell phones. Enough is enough, welfare recipients need to take care of themselves, because people are tired of taking care of their lazy behinds. I'm also tired of seeing people claim mental disabilities, why should we have to pay for their insanity, when physically they are of sound body.",1
9,"People try to use welfare to buy technology such as iPads. A lady in Walmart the other day tried to buy an iPad with her Link card. It is ridiculous how people are using welfare cards to buy stuff. It should be used for food and food only. If people don't use it for food, why are the taxpayers paying for it?",1
9,"Although the welfare system began to help people in need 50 years ago, we have allowed lazy bums to use it as their way of life. Americans are awesome people who want to help those in need. Now, we poor working Americans actually earn less money then the government gives to worthless oxygen-thieves! We struggle to pay our bills and go without health insurance, until Obamacare kicks in and bankrupts us. Of course, their will be no help for workers, because the takers have been allowed to play Xbox, talk on their 'Bama phones, watch free satellite, buy drugs and get SSI benefits, have more bastard children that they inflict on society because they don't care for them even though we pay them to be stay-at-home moms, and degrade our society and what America used to stand for! Decent working people that I know are ANGRY! The government needs to take notice of who's paying the bills. As a parent, I have to tell my kids ""No!"" Where is one ADULT in the government telling these moochers to ""Get a JOB!""?",1
9,"I know it's a cliché to say what would Jesus do. That being said, seriously what would he do? Most Americans call themselves religious and the majority of those would put the check mark on the Christian box. So, with that why would the same people simple call welfare lazy people who drain us and basically are a waste of air? I don't get it. Jesus always spoke about how the weak will be saved and all that stuff. Most Americans would say that they are Christians, but I guess it's easier to say we are something then actually be something. Bad things happen to good people, and if the people standing don't help the people that fall down then we are doomed. it's as simple as that. I wonder how many of the people who voted yes have actually been successful in life with absolutely no help from anyone whatsoever. The truth is EVERYONE in life has been helped by someone else, and unfortunately some people have to go to government.",-1

You may be old and broke with no healthcare or program to help you subsist in your later years. You are short sighted, narrow minded, non christian, and immoral.

Don't you think they're paying just like you are? Not everybody is handed a silver spoon at birth, and yes, their are people who abuse it, and yes, they shouldn't be allowed to collect, but if you do work hard and collect food stamps then yes, I feel you shouldn't be judge and yes o well if they have a nice care clothes etc.. They worked hard to so stop worrying about welfare and worry more about why are we fighting other countries and turning around and rebuilding what we destroyed where is that money coming from?",-1

They also have a 4 year old daughter. Should they be homeless beggars simply because no one will hire the blind guy? What about the wife? Penalize her because she got injured, while working, and can no longer work? What about the child? Should we keep the child from getting vaccinations and checkups because of their situation? It is not their fault. Just because someone is on assistance programs does not make them lazy.",-1

Where does this come from? What makes any of you think as a whole they have better insurance? They don't. What about the people who say ""they work their tails off, but welfare recipients are better off than me doing nothing."" I would say one of two things in response. You are wrong. there is no way someone who works 70 hours a week (as I read in one comment) is worse off then someone on welfare. Or, if by some miracle you are right, and they are better off than you, then I would say why don't you take a look at your own expenditures and make adjustments accordingly because you are doing something wrong. People, it sounds like all of you are jealous that they don't have to do anything. While that isn't always true it is sometimes. Would you rather sit on your butt and do nothing anyway? No, because it is depressing, un-fulfilling and shameful. That is the trade-off, a sad sad life, and the alternative to working hard. It is no life to envy, yet it seems all of you are jealous.",-1
9,"I used to be completely against welfare and food assistance. My husband had a great job and I didn't have to work. We had great benefits, money in our savings, the whole nine yards. Then he lost his job due to downsizing of the company. We tried for a year and could not find any decent paying work. We used all our savings trying to keep our house but ultimately had to move back in with my parents, who are both disabled and unable to work, leaving all the expenses to us. We finally both got jobs in fast food only because of a favor from a friend. But this was not enough. I cried so many times because I could barely feed my children. Then someone suggested to me that I should apply for food stamps. It was a very hard decision, but we desperately needed it. I can't tell you how wonderful it felt giving my kids ""seconds"" of dinner. Since then, thankfully, my husband has moved on to a better job. I'm still working in fast food and we are both going to college to get ourselves out of this rut. We still have benefits, but it's not much and it's not for much longer. And yes, of course there are people who abuse the system, but their really are hard working, honest people out their who really need the help. And I'm sorry if these people don't ""look poor enough"" for you.",-1
9,"Yes, I am on welfare. Without the support I get for my family from the state, which also comes from other people's pocket, I would not be where I am now. I decided to use the time I am on welfare to pursue my undergraduate/graduate degree. I am now 22 years old and will be getting my masters degree in May. When I start my career then that will be the time I will get off welfare and contribute back to the system/community. So people, don't label all welfare recipients as lazy, as I happen to be one of the most hardworking welfare recipients out their.",-1

9,"I know I always see people collecting welfare checks on the first of the month in a fancy Mercedes (sarcasm)! Poverty is real. The economy sucks. there are no jobs. People in one of the mightiest economic countries still live paycheck to paycheck. I actually pity those who say people on welfare are lazy and uneducated. Your average college graduate with all of his/her education can't find a job in today's workforce. So they go back and live with mom and dad? Good thing they have that safety net of parents wealthy enough to support them. Or they collect some kind of Government Assistance. And military vets are another group of people dependent on Government Assistance. They get out the military and struggle to find jobs. The struggle is so great that the government actually rewards employers for hiring vets. So perhaps when some of us judge others from our air conditioned houses, speedy internet connection, and smart phones should remember poverty is real. Hopelessness is real. People need help making ends meet. If you don't believe me drive through your nearest city and count the homeless. It saddens me to read 78% of people vote to remove assistance to the poor and in need. Because of a ""welfare queen"" stereotype. Obviously 78% of people don't know what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck. When ones salary is already spoken for before the check is even cashed.",-1
9,"their will always be needy and greedy.. is it really necessary to fund 'business lunches' resort vacations etc?? the amount welfare recipients actually receive in a month is equal to the cost of a politicians 'business lunch' that gets written off.. people who think they are 'supporting welfare bums"" are being ignorant and shallow.",-1
9,"Do you actually want people to live on the streets? I think the government needs to actually read application letters and investigate people's jobs and homes before accepting them. Welfare actually helps the people who live on the streets to find jobs and homes! Help the homeless, they need us!",-1
9,"If you people would educate yourselves you would see that not everyone on welfare is abusing the system or are lazy. SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE JOBS! But, our government is like you people who said yes, GREEDY. People cannot survive in these time nowadays. Cutting welfare would kill off people. Yes some of them are abusing the system and being lazy, but the majority of them are hard working Americans who can't help it. You may say ""well, they should have picked a better job."", ""They should have educated themselves more."", or ""they should have went to college."" Well, for starters, most of them DID go to school, they DID go to college, they DID pick a line of good work, but OUR economy SUCKS and those ""educated people who picked GOOD lines of work"" CANNOT find a job! So instead of being hateful how about you stop being selfish and help. Better yet, go do some research about other countries. We think we're number 1 right? Well we aren't. So stop thinking so highly of yourself and try to be a bit more humble.",-1
9,"I have seen many hard working families where both parents work but struggle to get by and receive min help or no help at all. I have also seen drug addicts receive benefits who have never worked one day in their life and they feel they are entitled to it. I know of 2 families in my area both are married the one couple have 11 children and collect benefits for all their kids, have nice things and the best part is the husband works under the table. The other family has 4 kids gets medical and food stamps for everyone and neither parent works they find their life doing illegal activities. How is that fair to anyone? I know a gal who works has two kids and is extremely ill. She has no insurance for herself and her kids are insured through their father. She is unable to get medical help so she can keep working because she has a job. The system needs to be changed for those who can help themselves and not for those who want to shoot up and pop out a dozen kids so they don't have to work. I understand that a lot of welfare recipients feel a sense of entitlement but this program was established for those in need. it's been abused so much that Americans are sick and tired of seeing hard earned tax dollars go to support drugs and laziness. I for one say keep the program but change it. Drug testing and sterilization to incompetent people who pop out a child ever year just because they can. their are to many people who work to hard and suffer a great deal. I also think illegal immigrants should not be allowed any benefits whatsoever. I love going to the store seeing a Mexican man whip out his food stamp card with pride and then walk out to his brand new SUV that he bought working under a stolen identity. Reform is needed.",-1

It is the only way to save capitalism as technological unemployment becomes a massive problem in the coming decades.

9,I believe that yes there should be some more regulations. Like the local drug dealer that's bringing in 10000 a month shouldn't receive welfare. But for ppl who work 40 + hrs a week and still can't make ends meet. How do they feed their families. The government can spend billions a year in defense for other countries why not take care of our own first. Millions live below poverty in the US.

You're losing more and more rights everyday to protect your assets... Just wait until you have no guns and no rights and those who need welfare can't get it because of your ignorance and guess who they're gonna TAKE it from anyway? You. Instead of indirectly through legally funded programs, they're going to break into your home or murder you on the street or rob and riot your place of business. Oh, and when they end up in prison, you'll be paying FAR more for them then you think that you are right now. FAR more. And they'll have better healthcare than you, free cable, no need to work, free food, a completely free ride, paid for BY YOU, Instead of helping them to support themselves and their families and encouraging them to learn, work, and contribute to society, you'll force them into extreme poverty or homelessness and they'll be in no other position then to take what they need however they need to take it.",-1

Welfare is a stepping stone and without it your home may be the next to get broke into or you care or family held hostage just so someone could eat go to school feed their family or pay for childcare.

I have worked since I was 15, so has my brother. My physically disabled mother has had two to four jobs at a time, since she was unable to work as an RN, from degenerative disk disease. If it wasn't for welfare my mother would be bedridden with pain. She would not be able to afford her (grossly overpriced) medication to cope with her disability. We also would not be able to eat as healthy of food and as regularly as we do. What we need to do is educate our country. We need to focus on low income communities and help them improve their quality of living without hurting their pocketbooks. Easy things like education of cheap nutritious and filling meals, growing gardens; so others tax money is not spent mostly on food. Better health care to prevent sickness instead tax dollars going into the repercussions of the illness.

Having as many as 4 children, with 2 parents, one working and one getting a check because he's a retired military man doesn't make them low-life, beat down people. They just need that extra boost to get food on the table for their children, a roof over their head and clothes on their back.

The Constitution was created and adopted to ""establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, ... [and] promote the general welfare"" among other laudable goals.

Justice requires that people believe that they are justly treated. How tranquil would this country be if the 'safety net' of welfare were removed and the jobless and hopeless were left without help? Do you not think that the general welfare of the whole country is promoted when people who have fallen on bad times are given a temporary hand until they can support themselves again?

Australia has a great welfare system, I will post the link at the end of this comment. I think we should make welfare recipients work for their check, and I think this program would work really well. Plus I think it would lower the amount of recipients on welfare (since the lazy ones wouldn't participate and would stop getting free money).

What's the alternative to welfare? Charity? Think about the anti-welfare argument that ""people are too lazy and greedy for welfare to exist."" I agree with the overall theme of the message, but the opposite is true. People are too lazy and greedy for welfare to NOT exist. Charity requires people to care, act, and freely give away wealth. I don't see this happening sufficiently enough to cover the needs of the disadvantaged. Also, welfare allow disadvantaged people to live dignified lives without resorting to things like begging or crime. This directly improves my quality of life, as I don't want to deal with this at all. If you live in the country or suburbs and don't see poverty firsthand as much, you might not think this is a big deal, but it is. I'll gladly have the the pittance it is every week taken out of my paycheck to keep so and so indoors and on his meds and teen mom from begging for money with her child on the subway while I'm just trying to get home from work and not be bothered. (Birth control and abortion should be free, safe, and readily available, but I digress).

Then a corporate asset-stripper buys the company at a knock-down price, closes the factory and sells the all the firm’s property to the highest bidder, making a fortune for themselves, but putting you and most of the townsfolk out of work in the process. So, you apply for Unemployment Insurance benefits but are told their has been in a change in law. “From now on”, you are told, “people have be personally responsible for whatever happens to them, which means, in your case, since there are no other jobs available in town, you are going to starve to death on the streets.

However, the government bureaucracy have no if extremely limited capability to differentiate those who need welfare due to being disabled,sick, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his/her control, to those who are just taking advantage. Thus, ending welfare might lead to a society where the unfortunate will be deprived of the basic rights to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of herself/himself and of his/her family. In closing, until a better method can be deprived, welfare is just one of these things we cannot completely kill.",-1

Then there's the matter of low-wage workers. Folks who work 40 (or more!) hours per week, with virtually nothing to show for it. Simple math would show that someone working minimum wage, full time, cannot afford one share of a two bedroom apartment in most states, if we include other expenses (utilities, food, transportation, and other needs like clothing, when the employer changes the dress code). I propose that anyone who believes that someone who is genuinely working a full-time job should be able to go without any one basic need (never minding more than one) should choose one if the needs above, go to a fast food counter, and tell the cashier what they don't deserve to have. Food? Transportation? Clothes? Tell them! it's your decision, and by your own admitted beliefs, I hold that it is your responsibility.",-1
9,"Quote from the New York Times during the Great Depression: (Feb 1931) “Several hundred men and women in an unemployed demonstration today stormed a grocery store and meat market in the Gateway district, smashed plate glass windows and helped themselves to bacon and ham, fruit and canned goods.” Families were homeless, living in parks. Humiliated, men who were unable to find work sometimes abandoned their families out of shame. Food riots were a regular occurrence. It’s estimated that 200,000 young boys left home to wander the streets and beg, to lighten the load on their families. Something had to be don't, so President Roosevelt enacted a plethora of new programs, collectively known as “The New Deal” which included a national welfare system. Although I agree the system isn't perfect and needs reformed, I think it's important to note that there are serious consequences for ending the system entirely. You won't just pay less taxes and go on your merry way. You'll pay in other ways. People will get what they need to survive - maybe from your house while you're at work. Jails will be overcrowded and have to be expanded. Who's going to pay for that? If we end the welfare system, we are simply moving our tax money from welfare to other areas. We don't end up with more money or better quality of life when it's all said and don't.",-1
9,"Welfare has been around since WAY before the 20th century. In the 1600's, the British classed the poor/homeless into two categories (really 3 but no need to go into that here): those who couldn't work (mentally retarded, frail, elderly, etc. and those who could but weren't (vagrants, lazy, etc.) Those who were ABLE to work were put to work and given necessities in exchange (not money). That, in my opinion, is what we need today: a focus on getting those who can work connected with a job. Additionally, I believe drug testing welfare recipients is an absolute necessity, but I don't think the welfare system should be ended entirely. We have a responsibility to help those who are truly unable to support themselves. No man is an island.",-1

9,"there was a man who worked hard supported his family and was able to give them what they needed with no help from the government. He had a wife and 7 children went to school and got his degrees. When his youngest was a year old he was let go due to downsizing. Luckily this man had been wise and had saved his money. He applied for different jobs all over the country every day for years and could not find a job. He now has used up all his savings and maxed out credit cards. What should this man do? Because of welfare he was able to continue to feed his family, take them to the doctor, get the kids immunized, the kids went to school in the public school system. When the 4 older kids were grown and moved out of the house he was finally able to get a good job again because his best friend brought him in to a company for help and then his friend died and he took over the job, not the way he wanted to get a job but it worked. 18 years of unemployment where he tried everything, applied everywhere, started his own business multiple times, what would he have don't without the welfare? Where would those children be today if it weren't for the welfare system?",-1
9,"Welfare is anything the government provides to assist its citizens, which includes money for healthcare, education, infrastructure, transportation, as yes, by this definition, giant corporations get ""welfare"" assistance in the from of cheap loans and subsidies to promote commerce in their sectors. Giant mechanized farms get welfare, giant defense contractors get welfare, giant pharmaceutical companies get welfare. That's the kind of welfare we can do without right now. When most people think about welfare, they think about fraud and abuse of food stamps and ""welfare checks"", which are intended to be ""temporary"" assistance. I think we're overdoing the means testing, including invasive drug testing, which is only making the welfare system more complicated and expensive to administrate. We can solve homelessness by giving people a place to live, solve hunger by making sure all communities have food banks that are full and soup kitchens are fully funded, help people without professional skills by giving them training and an education, solve unemployment by creating public sector jobs that pay decent and have benefits. Nobody who suffers should have to ""earn"" care in this country. All of that IS welfare. The welfare most people complain about, food stamps, TANF, Medicaid, is means-tested, and not as easy to get as you think. The best solution to poverty, from my perspective, is to get rid of all the ""welfare"" programs, and just send EVERYONE, rich and poor alike, an equal check each month, a guaranteed Basic Income, like social security. Would it be expensive? Yes, but so are defense and other industry subsidies which deny us of government services (or refunds) which could make our lives easier. The rich get an easier ride in this country in many ways, mainly by the capacity of their personal wealth to earn money through investments without paying as high a percentage of income taxes as on working wages. We could use a movement to build the nations shared wealth, such as it's natural resources, infrastructure, intellectual property, and manage that wealth to provide equal dividends for everyone, so everyone can share in the prosperity of the country, everyone could have a piece of that ""easy money"" the rich enjoy through sovereign investments, and at the same time properly charge market rates to businesses that use and take from our common wealth, instead of supplying them largely for free.",-1

She would spend ten hours of every day looking for a job while also attending online college. She works hard, difficult jobs that for a mother, sometimes makes her sick because they are so stressful. She isn't on welfare anymore because she had the support she needed to help take care of her kids while she was trying to outgrow the crutch of welfare. their will always be people who will abuse benefits, but their are also always going to be people who really do need it.

9,"Currently I am a college student, working part time, and trying to get my BSW (Bachelors in Social Work). Personally, I think abolishing the welfare state would be a bad thing. I work hard and am constantly pouring myself into my minimum wage job and into my education to better myself and yet I can't do it on my own. I rely on things like FAFSA, Student Worker Jobs, and government funded grants to pay for my education. But don't get me wrong, I don't come from a poor family. My father is a retired Sergeant First Class who served in the military for over 20 years, in places like Korea, Iraq, and Germany. Right now, he has a great job working for the government but it's still not enough to pay for my college. Not to mention, if the government didn't give my father disability benefits because he has suffered injuries in the war, not even his paycheck would suffice to pay his own bills. When we talk about the American welfare state, we often use narrow definitions and forget that welfare doesn't just cover things like TANF and SNAP, and whatnot. It also covers things like CHIP, health insurance, financial assistance to college students who are trying to better themselves. And if that doesn't move you, remember that the Social Security Act of 1935 is a big part of the American welfare state, and taking that away would be detrimental. And don't forget that a lot of legislation regarding safe workplaces, insurance, and education to all, comes from the extensive welfare state America has created. I understand there are people who abuse the system, I truly do. But criminalizing and demeaning the whole category of 'poor people', is not only uninformed, but it is not an ethical move. In every system their will always be that one person who abuses it, but if the benefits outweigh the costs then I would say we have don't a good job.",-1
9,"Welfare programs were created during a time in America when people were often too proud to ask for help and would only take charity when their kids absolutely needed it. their are so many circumstances where life takes us by surprise and all of a sudden, you are at the mercy of handouts. It should be a humbling experience that sparks energy into striving for independence at your core. I look around and see that this is no longer the case. I see more abuse of the system then proper use of the system. My vote would be a ""Yes"" to ending welfare programs if it weren't for the fact that I know good American citizens that want to support their communities find themselves relying on their fellow taxpayers for support. This system desperately needs restructuring. The country desperately needs this program to be restructured. Why? To prevent a culture of people who use this system as an entitlement from bankrupting the country, these are the same folks that don't contribute to the betterment of our great nation and whose children grow up to take this system for granted. We should all be angry at those citizens who make it hard for the people who need it, but we should be firm all the more in ensuring that the right people are in receipt of the benefits of this program. We need more community action to support each other and less government action. Communities will ensure that they are not being hoodwinked. Communities should ensure the growth and development of the youth of our nation. Communities will make the country strong again. Reform the system to make it damn near impossible for people to abuse it and learn how to take care of your neighbor. Take care of your neighbor and your neighbor will take care of you. Living for each other will make the country strong again. Technology has allowed us to get away from that. Technology will allow us to tighten the welfare system. Community will allow us to thrive without it.",-1

Neither of my parents have college educations so they both got minimum wage jobs. They couldn't afford to feed us and pay the bills so we began getting food stamps. We still couldn't afford to pay the bills so we moved into government housing. When my dad went to jail for domestic abuse and my mom got into a care accident that made her unable to work, that welfare was the only thing keeping me, my mom, and my little sister alive.

American should be supporting their country, but when someone is at a disadvantage then their should support them until their disadvantage is solved.

In several landmark studies in Canada and across the US in the 70s and 80s, they tried literally just giving entire cities a 'basic income' with ZERO strings attached -- literally just free money simply because you were alive. The net result was NOT that everyone stopped working, even though the 'basic income' was a livable wage. The people that stopped working were almost entirely single parents and college students -- both of whom, I think we can agree, have other obligations to attend to. In fact, the workforce dropped off by a mere 9% on average. What DID happen was that, given the ability to spend their 'basic income' entirely as they saw fit, people unsurprisingly used it to improve their standards of living. Most of the people in the test communities were supporting themselves beyond the poverty level within a year *not counting the basic income*. Seriously.

Children of lazy people shouldn't be punished. Therefore, a little of welfare is moral.",-1

The notion of getting rid of welfare means literally killing people. The anti-welfare Americans are the lucky ones sitting in front of their fireplaces, but welfare saves. As Americans we should all chip in for the common good, in order to ensure people don't die in our streets. People opposed to welfare should picture themselves without a job and food.

To conclude we should not get rid of it but we should control it.,-1

Sadly some people take advantage of what they are given but it's been shown in Alabama that job training programs get people off welfare. If we work with people who need help and help give them the the tools that are needed we can help lower the rate it takes to support them. Just because your on welfare doesn't mean your lazy. Like any situation there are exceptions, people who use what they are given and don't want a better life. This is sad but we can't just look at the negative side. their are people out their that want help that want to be able to support their families but are lacking the skills needed. it's our job to help them wither it's a small act or a big one. Do you think hard working people want to be called lazy? there are people out there right now on the welfare system giving their all to get off that system. People working like the rest of you. it's not right to just group everyone together as one. Would you say we are more civilized than the Romans were thousands of years ago? I would hope you said yes. Well Even in Roman times the government was involved in helping those in need who were poverty stricken by handing out rice to their people. Rome was strong we look up to them and have many of the things we have today because of them. So ask yourself why can't we help our people like they helped theirs?their are so many people that started from the bottom and worked their way up. Some people can do it on their on but some people need a push. it's like being on a swing. Some people learn to pump their legs really easy,while others need a push first.",-1

It benefits our society and nation to not have people starving on the street and to support people who don't have the money. Parents who have worked hard all of their lives should not have to see their kids go hungry just because they lost their job. We need to have a safety net in this country.",-1

I work 40 to 50 hours a week to pay for my family simple needs and I thought how I can report this human to a social work fuck If this human can afford for those expensive thing she should be able to afford baby formula, milk, eggs and their on groceries for their own kids and one more thing people please if can't afford to feed your first child why in the world are you having more children please stop bring children into this world if you can't feed them please stop.",-1

To advocate the end of welfare is to advocate a survival of the fittest society. Imagine for a moment who would support you if you were 86, disabled, too poor to eat? (approx. 44 Million Americans are below the poverty line.) You're basically saying that it is okay to watch people die because they are not privileged to have had good health, successful and loving children, a large retirement fund, good luck in life or birth, AND not or, an expensive education. If food, shelter, and health are human rights you are suggesting that it is perfectly fine to violate the rights of others AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT AFFECT YOU.

9,"Over 90% of welfare spending goes to the elderly, disabled, or children. With the vast majority in the from of Medicare and disability.

Over 40% of cash assistance goes to children living away from their parents. For every dollar spent on food stamps, the government sees a return of $1.80. And for every billion dollars in food stamp spending we create over 9,000 full time jobs. Before answering ""yes"" to this question, ask yourself if you would get unemployment after being downsized from your job, would you get food stamps if you had children to feed and your employer cut your hours? If you hurt yourself and were unable to work, would you take disability? Then maybe you're just one of the leeches you've been criticizing all this time. The welfare queen is the exception, not the standard. You know who gets welfare, by majority? Working Americans, trying to make ends meet.

9,"Poverty doesn't just happen to people who are lazy and unwilling to work. It can happen for many reasons. It can happen because paid maternity leave is not available (it still isn't in America, while in just about every other nation it is). It can happen because abstinence only education, lack of affordable and readily available birth control, and abortion restrictions can lead to pregnancy...When day care services are so expensive it could mean that mothers are unable to pursue higher education...Which can lead to a better career...They are essentially trapped in what is called the poverty trap. Some lgbt members, especially transgenders are at risk for poverty and homelessness. They can be thrown out of their homes from intolerant parents, and discriminated against in careers. PoC are also highly discriminated against. Often a white candidate is much preferred then a poc, even if they have similar experience or education. Foster kids are also especially at risk for poverty and homelessness. When they age out of the system at 18, they often have no work experience. Many also fare poorly in school and often have to repeat a grade because they are often moved from home to home in foster care. They also lack assets because their foster home is only temporary (foster parents put little investment in them, they don't even let the foster kid keep the furniture when they age out, they keep it for the next kid to come in care). Foster kids who don't have computers, cell phones, or cars can have a serious disadvantage over candidates who do have these assets. People in abusive relationships can also be at risk. Some partners are financially abusive; They may not allow their partner to work or have any financial freedom. They may get their partner pregnancy as a method to control their partners and prevent them from leaving or gaining independence So stop stigmatizing poverty. Even if someone is ""able"" to work, it doesn't mean that their circumstances allow it. Also how about some compassion for people who ARE physically unable to work due to disabilities? there are about 300 million people in the US. Currently, about 7% of the US is unemployed. That is around 21 MILLION people! Do you think those people should starve? Live on the streets? Those people include those with dependants, like children.

Capitalism doesn't really work for the majority of society; neither does trickle-down economics.

Okay first off, school is mostly public but you still have to pay for lunches and other school related events and materials for your child and with such low pay everyday you can't afford these so government Welfare is a save for them so they don't have to afford to pay for the expensive lunches everyday. Welfare provides Section A housing for seniors, disabilities, and also for people who couldn't afford buying full amount housing like the rich does because of the insufficient amount of income they receive from their paycheck. Welfare provides Food Stamps for those in need so they won't go of hunger and needed to pay for expensive foods because they don't have enough money to afford them.

I think we need to make it harder for people able to work to get food stamps. They are taking away from those who actually need them. Now a woman can have a baby and receive food stamps, WIC, medicare, and health care for herself. She can even get help with her bills.",-1
9,What if one day you lose your job? Or you get in an accident? What if one day you'll need to be on welfare for a couple of months? I mean I know their are some people that take advantage of the system and that isn't fair. I feel like the government should fix that and have more strict rules. They should check what the person spends their welfare money on and etc. But other then that I don't think they should end welfare. They should just end it for the people who take advantage of it and just use it because they're too lazy to get a job!,-1
9,"First off ending ALL welfare will inevitably mean millions would starve and die in our streets. From an economic point of view that would be bad for the economy as we would have riots, roaming gang and a skyrocket in criminal activity. Not only that but all the dead bodies would start to stink and someone would have to remove them. Although you'd still have to pay tax money to remove those bodies because they're not going to move themselves. So I guess people who work with dead people would have plenty of work. Now what I think should simply happen is Welfare reform. Mandatory drug testing at random. And no increases of food stamp money to women who have children on it. Take their kids and end their food stamps because as it is now we are rewarding women who have kids they can't afford by giving them more money for them. So I bet you these women would stop having kids if you threatened to take their assistance away. Also, it's not hard to create more jobs. Roads need cleaned, farms need farmed, stuff needs to be don't. Simply offer these jobs at rates that would compete with illegal work. For jobs like that you don't need minimum wage. That's a nice idea but illegals will take the work, if they can I'm sure someone face with starvation will take it if they have no choice. That's for cash money. I think people have a right to live, so doing away with it completely will kill people. it's like denying a dying person medical services because they can't pay. it's almost as bad as murder.",-1
9,"The concern about the the welfare program is that people might become too dependent to the government that they are already abusing it. Having said that, ending the welfare will not solve the problem. Absolute poverty will result to such abolition if ever.

Strict observance and implementation of the distribution of welfare funds must be don't to achieve the reform needed.",-1

9,Well is this really about welfare or is it the wrong thing your looking at like aren't the areas with the most abuse areas with zero jobs around high crime for the amount of people in the area? I'm disabled and 35 tbi at 13. I think disability should have funds to cover food on ssi and have a different card then ebt card or it be included on ssi payments. This would cut the question proposed in half mainly separate welfare - disabled and able working individuals. Then you'll see how much of a difference their is and what questions aren't being asked that are more important. Another thing that's really annoying is using 2 cards at the store. Plainly obviously irritating. On top of that these people saying yes are the assholes who depict what people eat on food stamps if they are dumb enough to waste their money they will go hungry who cares if they buy a lobster or a hot sandwich. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW ARROGANT IT IS TO JUDGE SOMEONE JUST TRYING TO BUY FOOD AND INSULT THEM CAUSE YOU don't ACTUALLY KNOW THE PROBLEM THEY HAVE. Like disabled people get 2 time the arrogance getting criticized over welfare and being on ssi. How about we cut all workers paychecks so double the people can work and put everyone on food stamps. Then the general opinion would change drastically. This subject isn't even debatable to be honest it comes down to the government and states and corporation's FAILING YOU! I don't get it what do people think their gonna get a refund for their paychecks? I think food stamps are preventing more crime actually myself. 100% if they stopped crime would go crazy in these areas.,-1

But as a hard working American because nothing is given to me and I have to pay my way all the way. I can't get free seafood or steaks I can only afford chicken, Hamburger, Pork chops.

I am an African-American woman, and I've worked hard needless to say, late into the evenings, earning credentials and sharpening my craft; which, among other things, leads me to feel that welfare can have a degenerate effect on self-motivation. I also feel that, who am I to judge each and every welfare recipient, and to what end or point? Only the Lord can measure accurately, each human being's story. But as a logical person, in that some children would inevitably go hungry if welfare, and such, were taken away, that alone makes rolling back these government programs, unacceptable.

I'm 18 and my father went to college and got a masters in education and is also an IT, yet due to his social anxiety and lack of social skills he can't seem to get a job. A while ago he had a good job and slowly things started going downhill. Now he works as a taxi driver, if we're lucky he'll make 100$ a day. My mother has cancer and is very sick and therefore cannot work. My father works his butt off to make the money he makes, and what he makes is never enough for me and my 4 siblings. Our lives literally depend on the welfare that we get: medical bills, food, etc. Whoever said that people on welfare are lazy, you have no clue as to how wrong you are. My father works every day(including weekends) he has never gotten a vacation day or sick day. Our life is not a ""lazy"" life we work extremely hard. I personally had multiple jobs throughout high school so that I could pay for any extra curricular activities and in order to go out and have fun with friends. If my family didn't have the welfare programs we have I can't imagine what my life would look like; it would be a nightmare. So yeah I know it's hard to part with some money and have to pay taxes, but don't you dare think that the recipients of your money are unappreciative, or even worse lazy!!",-1

I operated the business for 11 years but because the economy is bad from 2009 till now 2016 we are closing the business. I suffer from depression, have been on meds off and on. But now without an income I refuse to take welfare. I was born into a good family. I can't afford therapy nor meds, I have 9 breast lumps that require painful exams every year. But I skip those because it cost me $500 with insurance. I paid for catastrophic insurance since age 40. Now I am close to 50 with a very elderly mom who refuses to move out of her dream home. The government taxes her $9,800 for property taxes on a house worth $425,000. She will go broke if she needs nursing home care. She gets $400 left a month after paying MEDICARE part B. Life is hard.

9,"I have read through the comments of both sections and found that both sides have reasonable explanations as to why welfare should or shouldn't be ended. I think we shouldn't cancel welfare but instead limit the amount of welfare that one receives. We can limit the quantity of money that welfare people receive so that they won't starve and live in poverty, but rather that they cannot buy a lot of unnecessary items (expensive perfumes, multiple electronics, etc). This may limit the amount of abusing of the welfare system but also protect those who actually needs it.",-1
9,"Part 2: In my opinion, we as a culture, value both life and comfort too highly while those who abuse welfare seem to value neither. While this may seem contradictory at first, a bit of further observation makes it clear. When we are willingly given something of value to us, our natural inclination should be gratitude. However, when we are given something we expect should be ours, we don't often feel gratitude. Keeping in mind that ""rights"" are a human concept. Nature likes to remind us of this from time to time. You don't have a right to a single, happy, healthy child, nonetheless five. You don't have a right to a roof over your head and food in your mouth unless the people believe you do. However, even then, a privilege cannot be granted by a wish, even a collective one. Otherwise, we would all bow at the altar of Disney and be billionaires. However, every time we are granted something, we must remember that there's someone out their who probably needed more. So how can we be happy with what we get? Simple really: would our happiness have been truly hindered if we hadn't. If so, why? If the answer to that question involves or leads to want then it's time to take a hard look. Ultimately we give because we want to. Whether or not we should is based on the trade off: would we have been better off giving somewhere else or even not giving at all?",-1
9,"Part 1: Preventing people who have genuinely fallen on hard times and don't have an established social safety from being forced into desperate situations that would hinder their financial independence and general well being is understandable. However, the lack of fundamental restrictions to prevent abuse is a huge, glaring problem. Sometimes people need help paying the rent, but other times people need a slap upside the face. Culturally America frowns on the latter, which is a contributor to the problem. Quite frankly, this seems to come down not to the difference between conservative and liberal or republican and democratic, but to understanding the differences and implications of privileges and rights. A privilege is about want and a right is about need. Clearly many people continue to struggle to understand the difference between these two concepts. Perhaps a useful definition of a right might be something that will not be tolerated to be taken away. Such intolerance, however, is based upon beliefs and character, which are subject to evolution. As I see it, a privilege is something willingly granted by someone else. I say willingly because otherwise it is known as tyranny. If a government is granting a privilege on behalf of its people, it must understand that one cannot grant a privilege to oneself. That's called a decision. The misunderstanding of this concept is why true democracies fail and don't actually exist. No, America is not a democracy, neither is it a republic. It is meant to be representative. However, when people try to treat it as a horse racing track, the problems really begin. No one should ever need the government, but should it come down to that, the filling of that need should be in the best interest of all, carefully weighed. Neither opportunism nor outrage should ever be excuses for abuse in either direction of a decision where the greater good is concerned. Thus, culturally, it must always be understood that welfare is a privilege granted on behalf of the people to themselves via the government. The simple litmus test seems to be: would a moral, upstanding person find this case acceptable? This, sadly, comes down to the value of human life and comfort.",-1
9,This makes no sense why is it something to talk about not everyone understands this. I don't think welfare should stop most people can't afford food or whatever else they need like my family my mom cant. The check can only pay the rent so we have welfare to get food unless other people that would like to end this for more families starve and end up in more controversy.

9,"Most people on welfare have it for around six months to a year, get back on their feet and off they go. their are rare cases of people abusing the system, but seriously people where is your compassion? You really want to just let people who fall on hard times just die? With unemployment constantly being a problem in the United States what are people supposed to do? The principle of fiscal responsibility, of conserving money that's a good principle. But most Republican politicians who speak about that and then they tackle welfare are lying. If they really cared about small government then Republican presidents who have smaller deficits but they wind up with bigger ones! If they really cared then Republican administrations would be cutting the amount of subsidies that go to big businesses like tobacco oil and corn instead of giving them our hard earned money through taxes! I much rather give my taxes to someone who was just laid off, got divorced, and has to raise 3 kids then to giant corporations which have plenty of money already. They talk about the free market all the time. Is it a free market if the government hands over free money to giant businesses? NO. That's socialism no matter how you slice it or dice it. Giving a small amount of money to people in need, not as a permanent thing but to help them out in hard times is just lending a helping hand not socialism. If anything welfare helps capitalism be more competitive since less people don't wind up stuck at the very bottom of things and are able to reenter the workforce and offer their skills and compete. How does corporate welfare help capitalism? It DOESN'T! Both parties have been guilty of corporate welfare but especially the Republican Party. And then Republicans pretend to be for fiscal responsibility. I don't see why Democrats don't seize upon this opportunity to differentiate themselves and say the real irresponsibility is with the corporate welfare and then cut all those unneeded subsidies and show taxpayers the huge difference that makes compared to trying to save money by cutting welfare.",-1

You can create this idea of welfare just being ""taking from my paycheck and giving it to some other people who don't deserve it,"" OR you can look at it as it really is: a system whereby people are fed and kept alive through the money of the more fortunate. Welfare shouldn't provide money to those who don't need it, but it also should give enough to sustain people who simply can't afford the living expenses for one reason or another. Of course there are people who abuse the system. But it's worth having those few people when you're potentially saving the lives of so many Americans. Perhaps a progressive tax would be more efficient for raising welfare funds....? But that's a separate issue completely.",-1
9,"Welfare, a term that had stirred great discontentment amid the great economic downturn. Welfare, a public good held in high regard, whose sanctity is upheld through the mitigation of income disparity. Welfare, an undeniable means that had helped the poor to make ends meet. Welfare, an irrefutable channel where funds are rightfully placed to help the needy who are incapable of earning income. One may easily see the accent of welfare in contemptuous society. No doubt, just like any other public good, propensity of abuse slowly surfaces with the implementation of welfare. Opponents argue that people may quit their jobs and desecrate their productivity value in society simply to acquire welfare support. Is this true? Under a cosmopolitan society, is the welfare system so easily abused because of a severe lack of checks and balances? Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Article 23 Clause 3 - Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection. It is clear that the government has to stand firm as the protector of the citizens and to provide a basic means to live for it's people. It is absolutely abhorring and horrid should the government fail to provide an overarching social security net. In my proposed policy, I believe the government should not end welfare in the US. Obviously, while critics argue that propensity of abuse may exist, the question here isn't whether welfare should be ended. We should,instead,focus on tightening the checks on welfare applicants to prevent fraudulent applications. On the other hand, the social service council could very well ensure a strict and tightened criteria in which applicants have to fit before they may receive the welfare. For instance, one may need to be a disabled or the only family member of a disabled (in which they may have to be the sole caregiver). As such, I argue that the government does not end welfare in the US. By doing so, two great benefits would be ensured. 1.Poor and incapable citizens (who fit into social sectors such as physical or mental disability) may be provided with the rightful help. This encapsulates the protection of their individual dignity and honor while providing them with a means to continue their life. 2. Deserving candidates of welfare would not be granted access to them, as in status quo, where many receive welfare when a comprehensive check on individuals is absent. Welfare is intrinsic to every society. It is the backbone and the core of a nation, where the poor, the needy, the starving are entitled to basic means of living. Pursue of exuberant lifestyles should and definitely would be achieved when the person contributes to the society. Therefore, on the grounds of human rights, incapability of certain minorities and the intrinsic value of welfare, it is clear that the government has to continue it's providence of welfare.",-1
9,No I don't believe that the government should end welfare because their are people out their who actually need it.

If America did not have welfare, it's people would be a plague upon the world, rather then self supporting. If anything, the system should increase the $106k cap consistent with the rate of inflation so that welfare should be the last thing America should ever have to worry about. But all people and all firms should be contributing, if they are American. Tax payments and welfare are set asides that are a part of national infrastructure to prevent poverty, and poverty creep, not entitlements. But faith based initiatives are arbitrary, unconstitutional, and unAmerican. They are entitlements, pure and simple.",-1
9,"Welfare is a great thing this country has. It keeps citizens from starving when there is no work or work that pays well enough to feed house and clothe. I personally work 20 hours a week part time and also go to grad school while doing a 20+ hour per week GA position to help pay my tuition. If it were not for my parents I would not make enough money to cover housing, utilities, food, and internet. I know people in the same boat as me and I'm glad welfare does exist so they can get through school and so they can get a good job. Otherwise only the rich would advance in this country. What we need to end is the abuse of the system. The best way I see to do this honesty is to give the benefits to everybody who wants them meaning nobody needs to qualify to receive at least food. No longer will people complain that their money is being stolen by others who don't work. there's nothing worse than people living worse off by working then not and this would end that as well. Another thing we desperately need is a license to have children. overpopulation is the key reason the world is in the trouble it's in. The fact is there are just not enough jobs for the amount of people and nowhere near enough decent jobs for the population. it's getting to the point that people need to have a master degree and know a guy who knows a guy to get a decent job. Where as 50 years ago all you needed was a will to work. Unless a change is made in the 20 years you will need a doctorate just to get a decent paying job with benefits.",-1
9,"The Government shouldn't end welfare; rather, they should control how welfare recipients spend their money. Not in a draconian way where they government is breathing down their necks, but the idea of welfare is to help the poor and downtrodden get back on their feet again. their are some people out their who are perfectly happy to just collect their check and do nothing to give back to society. People on welfare shouldn't be able to just do whatever they want with the Government's money, because it places a burden on hardworking American citizens and taxpayers. Some welfare beneficiaries have children, which is okay. But if they just keep having children and cannot support them themselves, then they should be taken off welfare. Some people on welfare use the money to pay rent/mortgages, and buy clothes and food for themselves and their families, which is what the program is for. But then others buy expensive clothing brands like Gucci, Diamond Supply Co., and True Religion, and leave very little left over for necessities like food and housing. This is bad, and if the welfare recipient does not comply with the spending limits, they will be taken off. Simply put, if the Government made sure that welfare beneficiaries are spending their welfare money wisely, then it would be less costly for the taxpayers, and would further the cause to achieve the ultimate goal of welfare programs, which is to help people become able to help themselves.",-1
9,"I've noticed that the number one argument against welfare is that the recipients are lazy. This leads me to believe that maybe, just maybe, the people that believe that have never been in poverty. As a child, my family received food-stamps and Medicaid not because any of us were lazy, but because my mother is mentally disabled due to three brain aneurysms over the course of her life. So, according to some people, helping my mother feed her three children and keep them healthy was a waste of tax dollars. I suppose in their ideal world, a burst blood vessel in your brain is just tough luck and people with tough luck don't deserve help. Jesus said to feed the hungry and heal the sick, so every single person that says ""Yes, yes we should do away with welfare, because people need to take responsibility for their actions (or brain aneurysms) and stop being lazy slags and get a job"" are NOT ALLOWED to claim that America is a Christian nation.

9,"The idea of welfare, to the working individual, who is making enough money, and to those who are making more than enough money, will always appear as a superficial, unnecessary idea. To those who are in need of welfare, and to those who are directly at the cutoff for eligibility, definitely see it differently. The problem with welfare is that the rules and procedures of the welfare system allow individuals to take advantage of it. The welfare system was meant to be an ""in-the-meantime"" program that would provide the extra income for individuals who no longer have the ability to afford their current standards of living. Therein lies one of the biggest problems with the welfare system today. Participants in the welfare system tend to retain the same standard of living that they are accustomed to, which is not possible with their financial situations. The basic and undeniable reason for this problem is a lack of education. People don't get that they can't expect to have a great life and be on the welfare system. The welfare system should only provide a baseline, barebones lifestyle. Overhaul the system so that it can't be taken advantage of, and all spending issues become a non-issue.",-1

9,"Not all people in our society have similar access to education and other support mechanisms in order to succeed financially in life. Therefore, I feel that we have a responsibility to help our fellow citizens via welfare in order to create a more inclusive and egalitarian society, rather then one where the divide between rich and poor increases over time (which is happening in the US). This will occur if we don't provide for the most vulnerable in our community. Otherwise there will be no sense of community, crime rate increases, along with other evidence of social dysfunction. In summary, right wing views on welfare are misguided and suggest ignorance regarding how to create a unified, economically successful society where the talents of all people may be harnessed.",-1
9,"there is no thing as a ""welfare check"". It is a total myth that people just sit around and get ""paid"" a weekly check. Recipients receive food stamps and Medicaid (if they qualify). Some families get TANF (if they qualify and have to reapply every 6 months for a max of 36 months). A single parent with two children receives $271 a month. The monthly maximum for SSI (disability) is $710 for one individual. Adults must either be disabled and poor or have young children and be extremely poor to qualify for Medicaid. Also, recipients can get low-income housing assistance, childcare subsidies, and vocational training. Unemployment benefits are not considered welfare. Employers pay unemployment insurance taxes and reimbursements which support unemployment benefit payments. Employees don't pay unemployment taxes and employers cannot deduct unemployment taxes from employees' paychecks. It does seem like the system supports people who have children that they cannot afford, but children are children. They didn't have a say in being born. They are a vulnerable population and must be protected. And it is frustrating that people play the system. People who are ""on welfare"" and drive an expensive care are definitely getting supplemental income from somewhere else like their parents. I don't know whether to feel sorry for or disgusted by the parents. I would rather pay for these cheaters and give the people who work very hard, but just can't make enough to make ends meets, a fighting chance.",-1
9,"We should always take care of the elderly, the disabled, and children born in poverty. I believe that their are better ways to distribute help.....Such as teaching children about agriculture and farming. I am torn on this issue because I am a single mother who does not qualify for any government assistance and I struggle to provide for my son. I have a Master's Degree in Education and have been teaching for 6 years now. I barely bring home enough income to pay the bills and often have to borrow or take out payday loans to buy food and clothing for my son. His father is ordered to pay child support but I may get two payments a year. Half of my paycheck is spent on insurance and medical bills. So I do get upset when I see people abusing the system. However, not all people abuse the system and we have a responsibility to take care of the elderly and children and those who are disabled. Especially our military and their families. But their are better ways to help besides giving free handouts each month.",-1
9,"Of course it shouldn't end. It will just lead to lower wages in the middle class, more underemployment, and add to crime. Let the low class have the scraps. I'm more concerned about our wealthiest Americans running congress with their tax loopholes, tax holidays, and Offshore banks. Remember our biggest welfare check came from the Federal Reserve. Almost 800 billion tax dollars went to major banks. The same banks that gave out bad loans, foreclosed homes, cheat the tax system and use offshore banks. THAT'S OUR PROBLEM!",-1
9,"Yes, their are people who abuse the welfare system. But the largest group of recipients of welfare are Single Mothers. Mothers implies CHILDREN. All people should have a right to the basic needs of: Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Medical Attention. Especially those who are responsible for the safety of other human beings entirely dependent upon them for survival. I don't propose that welfare be given out freely and without restriction. Welfare should go to those of us who have a job and need extra money to help us survive and maintain our basic needs. As for those without the skills necessary for a job, welfare should provide training for basic skills that one would need in order to find a job. People who receive welfare benefits should then be required to find and maintain a job for some amount of time. After this given period of time ends, their welfare does as well. Problem solved...",-1
9,"A lot of people use the argument that they see freeloaders using the system all the time. But most people who use welfare are on it very temporarily. My mom was on welfare for about a year because she was laid off and couldn't find work at the time. Then she found work. And that's the case with a lot of people who use welfare. So the people you see with nice cars and cell phones maybe used to have a lot of money. They could've gotten laid off, and is using welfare to support them until they get a job back that can. there's also people who are so poor that denying them food stamps and welfare is sickening. And these are people who work extremely hard just to live. there should be ways to make the system better at dealing with people who take advantage of the system, but that percentage is small anyway.",-1
9,"My understanding is that the roots of US welfare go back to the depression of the 1930's when Roosevelt introduced support to destitute citizens paid for by new or expanded taxes on the wealthiest trusts or corporations. At that time there was a rise in socialism and communism around the world as the poorest of society, which was most of their citizens, revolted against their wealthy leaders of society. Roosevelt told the US business leaders that unless the poorest could be placated they too would be likely to call for a socialist type of government, and their numbers were great. A socialist government would probably reign in the power, influence and profits of wealthy businesses and people so the leaders of industry and finance decided to provide adequate funds to pay for welfare at a time when most of the US population needed some type of help. So the introduction of welfare was a successful roadblock to the movement of political power from the financial elite. It seems to me that although it makes sense that reducing welfare would force people into low paid work and off welfare it would create unrest that may result in greater costs to our consumer society. Of course by flooding the market with people desperate to work for whatever money they can get will cause a more competition in wages which would result in many more working people being forced to accept lower wages, so the number of disenfranchised potential socialists may grow disproportionately. I feel that people of all social classes are encouraged to consume, through the media and social pressures. Every day we encounter advertisements telling us what we should own, celebrities that demonstrate an expensive cost of living that we all are influenced to desire, so if a significant number of people are excluded through the amount of money they can earn they will be more likely to present a stronger call for a fairer system they see as fairer. Capitalism relies on rewarding the cleverest, best connected and entrepreneurial members of society at the cost of those who are less conscientious, undereducated, unluckier or lazy. Some have said that for every 1 winner in the system you need to have 50 losers, so if the losers find it too painful they have the weight to overcome the winners even though the winners can afford to protect themselves and manipulate the law makers. Maintenance of a sufficient welfare system allows for the winners to keep winning, and they can continue to look down their nose at those who have not fared so well by the capitalist system. This is even more important as recent trends have shown as the proportion of the population that are losers will increase dramatically and the number of winners will reduce. their are over 7,000,000,000 people in the world, and 1000 billionaires.",-1
9,"If I did not have the support of my parents behind me, I would require the aid of welfare to make it through school in order to support myself adequately. This is actually the case for many, many students in poor areas like mine who have to support themselves and pay for school on their own - many end up dropping out or don't attend at all, and are consequently stuck in poverty-promoting jobs. Just because a few people somehow manage to use a system for something it was not designed for does not mean it should be abandoned, instead it needs to be streamlined to support those who genuinely need it to survive, and turn those who would abuse it into functioning members of society.",-1
9,"I'm 20, graduated from high school, pushing my way through college, I'm currently 6 months pregnant, I'm homeless, jobless and just trying to get by until I can get back on my feet again. Before I found out I was pregnant I was working part- time at a dead end job, trying to get through my freshman year of college. Sounds like your typical college kid correct? I never even learned to drive, so instead I walk everywhere or take public transportation, I was able to find a job right down the street from my house so that I could walk to work. At 18 I lucked out and was able to rent a one bedroom apartment off of a family member. I didn't have to pay utilities and he was very flexible when rent came due. I had a cell phone, school fees, food costs, and sometimes had to shell out some gas money whenever I needed a ride out of town. Now THAT all being said, we can assume I was rather independent for someone of age 18. My boyfriend moved in with me and we started splitting up costs like any couple living together. Then i got pregnant, even though my OBGYN has been telling me since I was 15 that I couldn't get pregnant due to some reproductive organs malfunctioning. So needless to say we weren't as careful as we should've been. My boyfriend wasn't taking the pregnancy seriously so I kicked him out. Shortly after, I told my boss, that I was pregnant. And what did he do? Cut my hours to 10 hours a week.... He cut them back because you can't legally fire a pregnant woman unless you have a legitimate reason. Since I had been a GREAT worker for ALMOST TWO YEARS, he had no reason to fire me. Instead he cut back my hours to the point where he knew I couldn't live off of my paychecks hoping that I would voluntarily quit, his plan worked, no one can live off of that. I lost my house a week later. My mother, down the street has 5 other kids living at her house so I couldn't go their. I applied for welfare. I'm legally homeless, jobless because no one will hire a pregnant woman, and my grandmother is now struggling to support us and they will only give me 16$/month for food! I can't even get any help from the system to make sure my child remains healthy. So should we get rid of welfare? No, because their are people like me who just stumble upon bad times who could honestly use the help. HOWEVER I feel that there should be drug testing and other requirements to ensure that those who HONESTLY need the help are getting it! The system needs FIXED NOT ELIMINATED! (sorry it was so long but I feel you wouldn't be able to understand my opinion if you didn't walk in my shoes a little bit)",-1
9,"their well always be people in need because contrary to the belief of those in favor of destroying the welfare system, welfare is not simply about 'getting a free ride' on their tax dollars. Jobs are not available to every US citizen of working age especially in times that jobs are being outsourced and inexpensive illegal immigrant workers taking up field jobs that can be handed over to people already collecting a welfare check. People who oppose welfare display characteristics similar to jealousy and disgust that these people are living off their tax dollars while they happily work their 9-5 every weekday. They presume that all people on long term welfare are simply trash who are lazy and don't try at all and that they have no incentive to do so if they can get a similar standard of living to those on minimum wage. They neglect that fact that even senior citizens who have worked their lives and had no fancy retirement option in their line of work now often have to choose between paying the rent or for their prescriptions medicare won't cover. No welfare system is going to mean more people on the streets. More people doing what they need to do to survive. Once you hit rock bottom and you're slumming it on the streets, who is going to hire you? If you have no family that can or will support you, can't get into a shelter because they're always packed full why should that person not have a shot at some sort of living? The problem is with at will employment and too many low paying positions that even while working one can still qualify for Food Stamps. Other developed countries that have strong social-style welfare programs tend to have lower crime rates per capita, particularly among those collecting the benefits. So yeah, welfare... Not going away. If you want significantly less tax dollars going to welfare then either criminalize outsourcing or impose severe tax penalties for those companies that choose to do it when qualified labor is available in the 50 states. Impose a tax penalty to those corporate higher ups that dispose of jobs at the expense of keeping their bonuses which they have no shame in using government emergency funds for using either. Step up enforcement of illegal immigration, that can be resolved with providing a fair path to a work VISA and ensures the migrant workers are fairly paid as well. Why not do what's don't in some other countries such as Finland and put people into some sort of subsidized job for 6 months at a time? there are plenty of options available to us but those with the money have the power and will give up neither.",-1
9,"On the other hand, welfare families should be drug tested, or in a drug program. Welfare families should be held accountable for getting their children to attend school. Welfare families should lose benefits if their children miss school days. Welfare families should be required to do something to make themselves capable of work.Job training, schooling. It should not be free money. In the event that someone is handicapped, or has a handicapped child, then there should be allowances for them.",-1

Imagine a massive increase in the homeless population, double-digit increases in the crime rate, the massive increase in organized criminal activity that poverty at that level creates, tens of thousands of elderly deaths during heat waves and cold snaps.... I would have thought this debate was sophomoric if it had been 50/50.",-1
9,Instead of trying to get rid of welfare the government should have more requirements. Number one they should require drug testing and second have regular check ups on the families that are receiving the help to make sure that they are not abusing of it. It should be limited as well. Some people actually need the help so we shouldn't be selfish and ego centric but we should also make sure our money is being used well.,-1

Why do most US corporation pay only 11% tax, when you and I pay closer to 30+.",-1
9,For example this study performed by the department of labor shows that less than 2% of unemployment spending was attributed to abuse of the system. For 98% of unemployment recipients welfare is a stepping stone meant to tide struggling people over until the get a new job. Everyone will suffer if the temporarily unemployed are allowed to fall further into debt and poverty.,-1

Although this may be true for some people, the majority of people cannot get a job because there are no jobs available. Even low-end jobs such as cleaners - their are too many applicants for that process. I know someone who was denied a place working at a subway restaurant - if he cannot get that job, there is little chance he will get many others - abolishing the welfare state will only cause more social problems for society as a whole: their will be more homeless people living on the streets for example.",-1
9,"It really disgusts me that their are those on the opposition who are so callous towards all recipients of welfare. They attempt to categorize all those who are on welfare by personal anecdotes, that welfare should be abolished simply because they know a few bums who abuse it. Yes, their are ""Welfare Queens"" who readily abuse the system, but they are a vast minority and cannot possibly discount the majority of Americans unemployed by our economic crisis, the ones who cannot possibly support themselves who are physically disabled or mentally disabled. To categorize all recipients of welfare as the same is a mistake, and to end welfare would be a grave injustice against our American values. No system is perfect, their are always going to be loopholes and people who abuse the system. To end Welfare would be a blind and extremist action. Instead, we should focus on reforms which would allow us to weed out the ones who don't deserve welfare",-1

It would be nice if society was truly fair and people got back what they put in.",-1
9,"Marriages end, women are at risk of domestic violence, children would go hungry. Why on earth would you take away welfare? The rates of cancer, or lyme disease or even mental illness are rising. Then you would take these people including the people diagnosed with autism and say, ""no help for you."" Every member of my family died before I was 13 and I was placed in foster care and shelters. This debate must be filled with ridiculous hate. Welfare costs less to feed 50 million people then tax evasion, or terrorism or the money we pay for prisoners. Are you saying we should turn 50 million hungry people into potential prisoners? We pay less than 8 grand a year on good honest citizens where we spend 30 grand per prisoner. Why on earth would anyone consider cancelling the right to feed the poor?!",-1
9,"No. Welfare has a place; however it is abused and addicting. Any solution to the problem will cost the taxpayer, but in the long run it can be better. I suggest we find a way to promote education as an incentive to increase the welfare benefit. For instance: parents on welfare will be more likely to encourage their children to keep good grades, good attendance and stay in school if they benefit from their child’s education. Children who come from a home on welfare will become educated, have confidence, have ambitions, find better jobs and thus break the cycle of welfare dependence and abuse.",-1
9,"By far the largest part of any welfare package is medical care for the medically needy, housing/food for the mentally challenged, and unemployment compensation. If you wrote anything in the column on the left, be absolutely sure you want to refuse help to care accident victims, downsizing/OUTSOURCING decisions, and those born with deformities. Think of what you get in this life the next time you get in your care, even just to see a movie. Think about what it would take someone who cannot move on their own, or just lost their house through no fault of their own. it's not just about survival, quality of life is important to all of us. That's why most civilized countries today have safety nets.",-1
9,"Welfare, is an important system for a civilized nation. there are many people with disabilities, that find themselves in bad situations, or that are just the victims of whom their parents are. Welfare, if anything, should be expanded so it is available to all who need it. Now, that does not mean there are problems with the way the current system is run. there should be incentives for getting off of welfare (I believe this includes a national health care system, as many people simply cannot afford to get off welfare because the jobs they can take don't cover them medically). Frankly the carrot on the stick goes in the wrong direction. there should not be incentives to have more children to get more money etc. That is the wrong way to run Welfare. It should be an intermittent program for the needy, not a lifestyle from generation to generation that the more children you have the more money you get. Reforms are necessary, abolition? That is not the answer.",-1
9,"Think about how many people have a job because of welfare. People want to complain about it, but welfare gives social workers jobs. If it ended all those people would be out of work and headed to the unemployment line because they more then likely will not be retrained And most importantly, their is not even enough government jobs to keep those people working . Not only that, but ask yourself how many times you or someone else you knew hit rock bottom? This is simply part of life and their should be a system in play to help during those times. I'm not saying that it doesn't need to be changed or revised. I'm simply saying it will always have a place. In my opinion the system is set up for the poor to stay poor and the rich to be rich. That's why the stipulations on welfare has people scared to move. I think if the government gave people a grace period for 6 months before cutting or raising people's food stamps or rent, then they would get a better result. No one wants to be poor, but if food stamps and HUD are the only way to keeping lil Ray Ray and them from breaking in to my stuff , then let them have it. We all know that when people get desperate , and their stomach starts touching their backs, anything goes. Plus if we can take care of all these people who are not even Americans, then we can damn sure take care of our own. This is the land of the free and home of the brave and we should never go hungry on our own soil. Welfare or no welfare.",-1

They should be a safety net but the system has gone too far and should be cut. I think maybe, just maybe, the system should be privatized",-1

Small measures of reform, such as cutting welfare benefits to parents whose children don't make 'satisfactory academic progress' in school. If things like these were changed, there would be more of an incentive and more of a chance for welfare families to get back on their feet.",-1
9,Welfare has been around since the middle ages to help families who unexpectedly lose a job. I agree the system has grown too large and more regulations need to be put into place. It should NOT be more profitable to live on welfare then to work a minimum wage job. We must remember welfare is just put into place to cover up the bigger problems. Our current culture is to blame and we need to focus on educating and empowering our young people. We should not be showing them it is okay to depend on the government. Because when hard times come the government will not be the ones to save you.,-1
9,Welfare isn't bad but I agree it has too many loopholes. I believe in second chances but allowing people to collect for their entire life is ridiculous. there should be a maximum window where people can collect in their lifetime say one year or so. This gives honest people a chance to get back on their feet while eliminating parasitic drains on the system. Then take the rest of the money that gets saved and put it into law enforcement to catch the rise in crime after the free riders realize that they actually have to work but instead try to commit crimes instead of getting a job. Option two: make welfare a charity so the people that want to pay into it have the option to which eliminates taxpayer spending on this matter.,-1
9,"It is entirely possible for people to end up unemployed through no fault of their own and be unable to find work, particularly with the current state of the United States economy.

9,"those people are the ones that take advantage of the system, we should fix your system and force those ones to get on their feet but the purpose of welfare is a TEMPORARY SAFETY NET. Which means, you lost your job? You as a taxpayer now that are facing difficult times we will help you until you find job again. Welfare should only take some months, a year maybe two the most, not a lifetime. I understand people have a very negative view of it. I'm going to give you an example: my dad used to be the manager of a restaurant and lost his job two years ago. We had to file for welfare. Both my parents very hard working, worked all their lives in the resort business. My mom coming from a third world country worked full time scrubbing floors since 17 now she has several major physical problems so my dad is the only one who provides for us. So anyway we got welfare for around 6 months, we got food stamps and medicaid (which I agree is not fair that people on food stamps gets to eat better than us) and he paid the mortgage with his savings, he did a driving class to get class A license and is now a bus driver. That's it 6 months on welfare so my father could get back on his feet. So people that said yes, I understand how you feel and we need to fix this problem not eliminate it. Cause to a lot of people like my dad it is temporary help",-1
9,"The amount of people in poverty in a nation like the United States is unacceptable. We need to reform the system so that people who need the system get it (because there are many people in need who can't access welfare for one reason or another).

That way, laziness in the welfare system would end.",-1
9,"Okay, I'll be the first to admit that their are people that don't need it, that get it. Those people should be handed a job and if they don't cut it, well then sucks to be them. However, their are people that genuinely need it and deserve it. Single parents with children not of school age, the elderly without a pension, people with disabilities, and people who are legitimately down on their luck. Not to mention people trying to go to school. Especially those who come from less desirable backgrounds. People who don't have parents to help them out. How many people in the US are living off of their parents or family's money? Probably more than those who really need assistance that are on it. I have NO PROBLEM with tax dollars going to people who need help. Especially those with children. I do think that the system needs to drug test individuals though, or screen those in receipt more thoroughly. Why do so many people have a problem with tax dollars going to welfare recipients as opposed to those who have a problem with tax dollars going to corporate bailouts, nuclear testing, and warfare?! I would much rather the government put money towards life as opposed to the death resulting from wars overseas. Just think about it.",-1
9,"The government should provide help for the needy, but not fulfill every desire. The use of unemployment checks and EBT cards is a broken way to do this. Giving out ""free money"" just allows those who don't know how to wisely spend money to waste money again, instead of taking care of their long term needs. A parallel would be giving money to a homeless person, who might spend that money on alcohol or drugs. Giving money to the needy often does no good for the needy, or society as a whole.",-1

Granted that their are people who mooch of the system, statistics say that 70% of people on welfare do bring in a check once a week. The system should have more checks to see if the people have a job or not but welfare be removed. Welfare helps a lot of people, open your eyes to all the poverty in the world.

But for the people who just want to live off welfare for their whole entire lives they shouldn't get any welfare it would just be better to send the kids to a foster home. Because the parents will never encourage their kids to have a good education and they will end up missing days of school to take care of their siblings and the poverty cycle will continue. And if they want welfare help they should be required to go to college.

I do agree that if you're abusing drugs you shouldn't get any aid but people tend to think all those on welfare are users which is discriminating. What I don't understand is why do they give a company 20k plus to have someone on a Get Back to Work program and after 6 months the person is not only not getting any money but also getting their HRA with no inventive of getting a job with the company and getting welfare. The corporation is getting welfare and they don't need it. The system needs reform. A better back to work program is needed.",-1

9,"Often times the media portrays those on welfare as mooching off of the government. This cannot be farther from the truth. Welfare helps not only the disabled and the elderly who are not able to work, but also children all around the country who would starve without it. To promote ending welfare would be nothing more then denying those who are able to work and are trying to get a better paying job the opportunity to do so. That would be systematically keeping the rich rich, and the poor, poor. To say that those who make bad choices deserve to live with their mistakes is rubbish. If their mistake was bad enough then they would've gone to jail, and when they got out they would no longer be able to receive government aid. it's human behavior to look out for the next person. To openly say that children deserve to starve is subhuman and downright disgusting. Welfare has caused MANY people to get back on their feet. Although there are those who misuse it, don't allow that to spoil it for those who do need it. If you're complaining about your tax dollars are going take a look at the US aid to Israel...Look at the amount that they spend on the military. The welfare system is NOT free money that people spend on unnecessary items. With the cost of living so high, they need to just to put food on the table.",-1

9,"it's real simple. If you have a lot of desperately poor people and a small number of very wealthy people, what happens? The poor people get angry and they take what the wealthy have. Maybe out of desperation, or necessity, or maybe out of just plain greed and envy. Aristotle noted it. Benjamin Franklin noted it. it's a simple fact of human existence. When the many have very little and the few have a lot, the many will use their advantage in numbers to take from the few. Welfare short-circuits revolution. Plain and simple. Desperate people will do desperate things to survive, advance social, and gain economic success. By creating a system of wealth redistribution, that helps spread around the wealth of the few to the many who are poor, you prevent civil unrest and collapse.",-1
9,"Many families have found themselves in a situation where they need financial help and they have no family or friends to turn to. Oftentimes families become impoverished because of mental illness, physical illness, loss of job, or foreclosure. there is no way to tell who truly ""NEEDS"" assistance so the only fair this to do would be to provide services and just hope that people don't take advantage of it.",-1
9,"If the Government does not provide benefits or the poor, then no matter how much the people who pay taxes now dislike paying taxes, they are going to get higher because their will not be as many people left to continue the spending that the economy needs. their needs to be people spending money in order for their to be a continual flow of money. If not, then the economy will surely crumble. Also consider the moral aspects of government benefits. The same people who act as if they are sympathetic towards other countries without beneficial government regulations are some of the same people wanting the American people to relinquish the idea of government help. When the economy fails, then only the people with money are going to be able to provide for themselves, and surely those people are going to only look out for themselves and their families. Perhaps I am not the most educated in this topic, but I believe that without government help, America will become an even more destitute place then it already is.",-1
9,"How is it right/fair for immigrants and illegal aliens to receive better/more state/government assistance then me, a born citizen of this country? I DO believe that there should be modifications made to welfare in this country, but it should not be ended. Getting rid of welfare doesn't solve the problem of poverty in this country. I'm for drug-testing, and taking measures to be sure that people aren't abusing the system. People abusing the system has made it next to impossible for me to get the help that my family needs.",-1
9,"I understand the other side. Waste, fraud, and abuse are a real concern. The people cheating the system are not the ones I concern myself with. their are real people with real needs that for one reason or another cannot provide for their children's daily needs. Welfare fills a much needed gap especially in a down economy. there are plenty of laws on the books to handle the waste, fraud, and abuse but for now it appears cheaper to pay then to prosecute. The same goes for other hot topic issues like gun control and immigration. there are plenty of gun laws; few are enforced or prosecuted. there are plenty of immigration laws; few are enforced or prosecuted. Those who want reform just need to get officials to enforce the laws we currently have and many of our problems with welfare will disappear.",-1
9,"Especially in today's economy, welfare is a very important program to combat hunger and poverty. While it may be exploited by some, that is no reason to discount everyone else that needs the system to survive. For some people, their are just no other viable options available to get by.",-1
9,"I don't believe that welfare should be eliminated, but should have more stringent guidelines. I think that it should be reserved for only those who actually need it.

Low paying jobs are insufficient to make ends meet, and are best used as a supplemental income. People who can't find work, for whatever reason, need to be helped. I think efforts should be made for and by welfare recipients as far as finding work, but we will always have a certain percentage of the population who just can't make it on their own.",-1

Now if the money they gave me is being all paid back. Then why some people are saying that people on welfare is stealing from their pockets. Anyway like I said I had went back to school now I am a nurse.,-1

My mother is on food stamps. We have only recently gotten over our pride and asked the government for help (about 3 months). Our family includes 5 kids (all hungry teenagers) and my mom has gone back to school. So before you say everyone on this program are low-lifers, pause and check yourself. Stop stereotyping and gain the full facts. You are biased because you've had a couple bad experiences and judge the system based solely on this. Yes, welfare is abused and it needs to be better regulated. But the whole program should just become smaller not disappear altogether.",-1

I know a lot of scumbags who live off welfare and they are totally fine. for example; my cousin she is a single mother, who doesn't work, doesn't go to school, her health is perfect She's just lazy living off other people's income.

9,"To say that ""Communism just doesn't work"" is the equivalent of saying that man was never meant to fly because the first airplane the Wright brothers made failed due to sabotage by a care company. The millions of examples of Stalin and the North Korean dictatorial regime are so foolish and ignorant I laugh every time I hear a sheep say it. They don't represent true Communism so they should not be told that those are examples of real Communism. Yet every time a sheep hears Communism they instantly enter this ""Attack"" mode almost like they have been programmed to do so. it's really shocking how many people really don't understand true Communism. Another point to be made is that typical capitalists love to say how it is ""good in theory"" or ""it looks good on paper."" Well, unless the writer is a complete sociopath, what wouldn't look good paper? The goal, like ANY economic/political ideology is to strive to reach that system. Communism has NOTHING to do with ruling others or oppressing anyone. Everything we feared about Communism - that we would lose our houses and savings and be forced to labor eternally for meager wages with no voice in the system- has come true in capitalism. To all the fools, do the research and understand Communism for what it truly is.",-1
9,"In theory, communism does work a lot better than capitalism. However, the reason it doesn't work in the real world is due to the problem of human nature. there is nothing flawed in the theory, except for the expectation of Marx that humans will work for the good of others. This just shows that we, as humans, have yet to understand the idea of generosity, and caring for others to an extent where we think beyond profiting ourselves.",-1
9,"With Capitalism trade and industry is controlled by the rich and they are the only ones to reap the rewards, but with Communism everyone reaps the rewards. The rich own everything in Capitalism and make up the ""Upper Echelon"" of society, while in Communism everything is owned by everyone. Communism has its problems, but it's still better than Capitalism",-1
9,"better' is subjective term, 'rational' is not. No living from, except humans, can own anything, be it land or object. That is' Special Pleading' fallacy since it is not explained why humans have such special rights. Dog surely thinks that he owns that tree-he marks it, yet we know that this tree is not his to own. Thus, simply holding a belief that you own a private property does not lead to conclusion that you actually own it. Until someone can present us with logical explanation on why life forms A/B/C cannot own a property while life from D can, we must conclude that private ownership is irrational and illogical (I'm willing to debate this in greater extent). Note: Argumentum ad populum will not slide here. Just because you have large group of people agreeing with you that this piece of land belongs to you, doesn't mean that it actually does. Money is not effective. Commonly sharing all end-product will result in all involved individuals having equal share of everything that is produced by whole group. Money will lose it's meaning since everyone will have everything. their will be no need for middle-man (money). We lose nothing and we gain a lot. Since all products will be equally distributed among involved individuals, no single individual will have something other individuals don't. Think what this implies... Capitalism is about profit, communism is about common good. This is self explanatory. Communism is pure democracy, capitalism is not. Since you cannot make everyone happy, closest thing you can do is to make as many people happy as possible. Giving minority rights to limit actions of majority is irrational, because you are exchanging happiness of one large group for happiness of small one.",-1

9,"As an American Communist I think Americans really need to learn what Communism is. it's NOT no classes, it talking your hard money, and not a single country has ever been Communist. Marx was talking about the removal of the bourgeoisie. The people that have more that they can even spend. That their needs to be limits on how much wealth one can have. it's people like Warren Buffett that would be affected. I find the state of America sad. This Thanksgiving their was people eating off gold plates drinking wine with $25,000 a bottle. This while good hard working families couldn't have a turkey. That their was innocent children that when to bed hungry on a Holiday about giving to others. “The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not don't away with class antagonisms.

Communism without a corrupt leader will allow the human race to advance infinitely.",-1

9,Because everybody gets an equal salary so in turn a new communist democracy will reduce the prices of everything to match the pay rate of the people. This therefore would benefit everyone who is struggling with salary (majority) and won't benefit the rich (minority).

Most people might say that equality is better but then they try and make themselves better than everyone else, day in and day out, by trying to earn more money, be promoted, buy more stuff, then everyone else. Therefore most people are hypocrites. Communism is better because the human race would live longer if everyone believed in it. We will only reach a situation like that in a Capitalist society if all the population earns their money and then gives most of it away to the needy or back to the state to redistribute on social projects. We might end up with fewer toys and fast cars and big houses. But it's a small price to pay for ending poverty.",-1
9,"there are certain aspects of Marxist thought that work well in theory, they just haven't been implemented as well, the USSR's fall adding fuel to the fire of conservatives who want to impose the more punitive idea of pure, unregulated capitalism. Working hard to get ahead is a fine value that should be commended, but mocking and sneering at the poor and working class and ordering them to ""pick up their bootstraps"" while ignoring their side of the argument is callous and immoral. A strong, competitive economy is important, but we also need to guarantee a basic standard of living for everyone, not just the 1% elite. We need only look to countries like Canada, Germany, and Sweden to see successful examples of a socially democratic system.",-1

9,"A lot of the opposition say that examples of Communism in history haven't worked. I agree; that's not about the economical system however, it's the people involved. People are garbage. Capitalism thrives on garbage people whereas communism gets a power imbalance. Capitalism (CT) encourages enemies out of each other and enables huge wealth inequalities. I agree with this statement and believe the following is good: Give what you can and take what you need. In other words, I am a Marxist. Furthermore, Examples of communism in history (China and the USSR for example) were corrupt and I think they could've don't better. That doesn't mean CT is better. The Soviet Union did genocide in Afghanistan; that is morally wrong. The United States is doing the same thing. The economical structure doesn't mean anything about the fate of the USSR and China. In fact, I would appreciate more structure and fewer freedoms. Isn't overwhelming to go to a grocery school and see so many options. Each packaging trying to convince you to buy the product with bright colors and bold words. Additionally, It would be easier to enforce laws and solve global problems.",-1
9,It provides the support for the people that we so desperately need. Even better would be a peaceful overthrow to reduce fear of it. All current and previous forms of established communism lack a free will of the people. So we should establish a communist society where all have free healthcare economic support and equal rights.

9,Communism treat people fairly. In Capitalism some people are ridiculously rich and poor. Some people starve to death cause they don't have enough money to buy and killed more than 100 million. People in Soviet Union love communism because they have everything that they need. United States won the cold war cause he did not participate in WW2 so they have a higher chance to win in against the Soviet Union in cold war.,-1
9,Communism has only failed due to the miscalculation of the leaders. If we were to have a government that was loved absolutely by the people then communism would be superior. One party states must be communist. Though I personally believe that we could achieve equality through the redistribution of wages and tax depending on the needs of the individual and using the profit of things we want to fund more important thing then big bourgeois bastards,-1

The USSR was a Stalinist government not communist. North Korea is a dictatorship. Modern China is a dictatorship with a free market system. All the bad things we hear about Communism is the US influence. Even other countries view communism as a bad thing because of capitalist influence. Capitalism is the cause of corruption.

Where is the Opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Communism, Against the more advanced opposition parties, As well as against its reactionary adversaries? Two things result from this fact. I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European Powers to be itself a Power. II. It is high time that Communists should openly, In the face of the whole world, Publish their views, Their aims, Their tendencies, And meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.

The US claims to be super christian, Yet the conservative party overwhelmingly supports attacking other countries for oil (iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Etc). We leave our homeless in the streets, Sick addicts get locked in prison, Anti war potheads/hippies get targeted by police more than murderers and rapists do.

You won't have to be searching for jobs, Finding the only job around then working 60 hours a week and being stressed by the people higher that you watching every move.

The idea of political figures elected who have power in administering changes in policy can work alongside communism. ""owned by the state"" does not mean that these people would be wealthier.

9,Communism is good because communism is great. We need more of it. Because I like when i have no chocolate and my friend has 2 i should get the other cuz it's unfair. Sure he works harder and helps the poor out but i want his chocolate so i should get it,-1
9,"When we are mostly wealthy and some of us are poor we should split the wealth. Some people struggle to get food, but with communism, everyone can eat and not have to worry about starvation. With capitalism, many people have a hard time finding a job and they can not feed themselves or their family. Finally, their will be no social classes and people won't have to worry about their money.",-1
9,"Communism while going against human nature can possibly work. While communist governments normally fail due to dictators you can make a communist democracy. If communist governments used democratic ideas to the fullest they wouldn't collapse. Because the people would want to be in government. It would feel like everyone would matter. But the thing is human greed is what makes communism fail. But if you can manipulate the majority to believe in not human greed, but doing a job because you want to do it.",-1
9,Communism takes away the classes and makes us work harder which is very good considering that most of us in the us are fat slobs who mooch off of the government's welfare. Plus people will stop fighting over the petty class system that breaks us apart by us comparing our amount of money and assets.,-1
9,"Communism revolves around Marx's economic theories, these theories infer that the pricing of products should not be based off of the supply/demand but rather off of the labour put in to it, this significantly decreases the potential for marginalisation in the industry and other places of production. Communism is as Mao Zedong said ""not love but rather it is a hammer which we use to crush the enemy."", loosely translating into the fact that communism is a power, a power of progress and mass production in fact communism itself revolves around producing goods at a significant rate with all money made from sales put back into improving the system, this can lead into further scientific and economic progress and definitely is a step forward. To those who would use the USSR, China or other 'communist' countries should be aware of the definition and implications of Communism and the fact that neither of these countries were actually communist, in fact there's never been a communist country, USSR itself stands for 'Union of Soviet Socialist Republics', clearly no communism to be seen.",-1

9,"Communism may work for a patriotic country with the intention of no man, woman or child left behind. However, once you have a society with diversity, it leads to racial profiling and discrimination and communism is not a good idea. In a diverse society, their will always be a group of individuals who may want to assert their powers over people from other backgrounds.",-1
9,"The main reason I believe Communism would work better is because of the way our U.S Government runs right now. We have constant issues throughout businesses and soon enough the world is going to run out of excuses. Everyone assumes that communism is bad but there are 2 different kinds of communism. 1st wave, AKA Marxism, is genius. We would fix poverty and hunger issues and everyone would be able to trade utilities and jobs with other people. 3rd wave Communism, or what I call Stereotypical Communism, is where the country or provenance is run by a dictatorship and all of its citizens are treated unequally. I am a 13 year old in Iowa that is just trying to make a point across that the way the U.S Government is running right now is just pure idiocy.",-1
9,In World War 2 most women were not allowed to fight except the soviet union which was communist and women proved as excellent fighters. Where as capitalist countries had very few women fighting in the front lines. The women that fought were mostly voluntary and communism will spread. The end,-1
9,"The reason the majority of Communist countries have failed is that they are also usually dictatorships, which does not work, I believe that a communist-democracy system would be more efficient and effective then the conventional capitalist- democracy as their would be far less crime over money, there would be more opportunities for higher education and jobs.",-1
9,"Most people believe that it ""doesn't work"", but this is because they are brainwashed by companies and government because they don't want to lose their power. And when they hear of communism, they automatically think of the leadership from Stalin and North Korea, but under these leaders, they have never practiced real communism, so it shouldn't be said that it ""doesn't work"" because it has never been practiced.",-1
9,"Communism gives equality to everything however, It has never worked in practice because of people. Lenin made a beautiful Union, everyone was equal but it was destroyed by Stalin. The theory of Communism is far better than Capitalism. Capitalism is built to benefit the high class so they get richer while everyone else fights for scraps.",-1
9,"Even without money, working hard at your job will still be rewarding as it could result in more power in said workplace or extra vacation days. Not only that but it is human nature to try and improve ourselves, so going against that would be hard for us to go against this",-1
9,"Not everybody has the things they need to live with capitalism, but with communism they can have it, now a communist country isn't automatically a dictatorship, and capitalist countries aren't automatically a democracy, (russia is now dictatorship) it's only that no communist countries have been democratic. But in capitalism people that do have money, they live good lives, so i think communism and capitalism are good and bad equally",-1
9,Communism will solve all problems and bring us into the glorious beginning anew in a equal and prosperous regime. Capitalism will cause divide and distraught and ruin equality and reputation. don't be stupid be a smarty come and join the commie party! So what do you think now ay?

The Soviet Union was given free housing! The USSR had a very high level of security. The USSR was not homeless. In the USSR the pensioner was provided. In the Soviet Union was a real people's democracy, not the false representative. The ideology of the common good makes people kinder. PS. The USSR had one major drawback - their were no frills.",-1
9,"True communism has human face and soul, it is made for all people in the world instead of Capitalism which has ugly predator bloody face and demonic vampire soul, but communism can not build if one country in the world has capitalism system, all states and nations must live in one communist country otherwise communism will looks like poor Stalinism or looks like China hybrid economics where 99% of nation are poor and only 1% are billionaires",-1
9,Everyone says that communism is horrible and makes everyone poor but in fact you have to work to get anything it isn't like if you don't work you still get stuff and besides the Soviet Union isn't really a good example of communism as sadly corruption made it much much worse.,-1
9,"It is better as the idea of equality would mean things like dream houses wouldn't exist, and then the shortage of crude oil wouldn't be as bad as everyone would just have what they need. Furthermore, homelessness wouldn't be such a problem with the idea of equality in Communist societies.",-1
9,"In communism nobody is worth more than anyone else, everyone is worth the same. You work for your fellow man and he works for, if he needs help everyone is to pitch in and help same for if you need help. In Capitalism they create classes to spread and separate us, with the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming more poor. People say that communism is a failed system well it's not the thing that failed it's humans that fail and blame it on the system.",-1

If they scream and holler during protests about that and their attention is focused on men and white people but not capitalism because that's how they get their money from unfair class based system which is kind of ironic, if capitalism was replaced by communism would they need to exist then?",-1
9,"In the capitalist state, the full destruction of the rights of mercenaries and merchants are restricted not by the state, but by the unions who destroy them internally. The business leaders, without restrictions, restrict themselves without expanding the economy. Thus, in a communist run anarcho-capitalist state with a socialist economy, the restrictions on business are artificial but not artificial simultaneously. This allows the ever expanding universe to doubt the very reigns of communism itself in the development of anarchy.",-1
9,"If you don't think communism will work, then it will. This backwards logic was not applied in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. They thought communism would work, so thus it failed because if the market cannot flourish on it's own, the state should begin to doubt the establishment of the free market under implementation from the IRS.",-1
9,"The reason why we North American and rest of the world doesn't like Communism is because we know what happened to Russia, Cuba, Vietnam, China and North Korea. Stop being bias and open your mind to Karl Marx's idea. The reason why Communism doesn't work is because human are very selfish and always act in their own interest. it's just doesn't work doesn't make it a bad idea. If Einstein was part of the KKK, the world right now would probably never recognized him as one of the most important scientists have ever lived. Karl Marx needs recognition by the world as one of the best philosophers have ever lived",-1

9,"It totally depends on the era and the situation. As i person from a country with mixed economy, i can see from both point of view. True that capitalism promote self individuality and chances to rise above the norm. But one thing that people who support capitalism blindly just because they're told that communism is evil since youth have to realize is that, back when communism started in countries like russia or china, they HAD NO BETTER OPTIONS. Hundreds of millions died. And hundreds of millions more would if it had not been for their government to side with communism they would have suffer a lot more than they already did. For people in those situations, by supporting capitalism it will only create the new sets of people that will rise into power and abuse that power through their larger base of wealth. And as you can see in the modern days, country like china has going a bit to the capitalism side everyday. Point being, they chose communism to survive. Not that the situation changed, they are going with the capitalism side. But war comes and go. Communism is good for a country recovering from war. It really depends on the situation. Use common sense. So is communism better than capitalism? Yes. And No.",-1
9,"Love is arguably the most important thing in life. In a Capitalism the pursuit for wealth is the priority, this means that many men and women choose their partner because of their financial stability. It is almost impossible to see an A-list celebrity in a relationship with a beggar because of the vast financial difference. To oppose this with communism it is easy to deduce that with only one class love is easier to find and so is true love especially. In a communist society that A-list celebrity might talk to the beggar and they would consider a relationship because they are on the same level. So the only thing to take into consideration in a communist society is if two people truly love each other. - Luka Slav Commie",-1

9,"Communism, more economic growth, easier for the country to develop and the government growth is easier and the country has more risk and will be more stronger, and capitalism countries shit their pants to do shit to another country and capitalism countries are rich too but in my opinion communism is better",-1
9,"Capitalist countries are known for their- sometimes- great economy and the freedom that they give to rich people, and that's good, but if you`re not rich, you`re screwed, unlike communist countries, in which the basic needs, such as health, education, etc. ..., are covered by the state. Personally, I think that poor people deserve to be equal to rich people, that's all",-1
9,"I am not a communist, but i think that communism is better than capitalism (I don't think communism is good, I just think it's better) because it promotes equality between all the people by increasing taxes to the rich, so everyone will have the same. Communism, generally, helps people by helping them with their basic needs, such as education and health. The bad part of communism is that, it isn't democratic, which is why I am not communist, but capitalism isn't entirely democratic either, capitalism has a democracy that is a facade, this can be shown in the economic and military support that the capitalists gave to some dictatorships in South America and Asia. Capitalism may be tempting because if you have money to spend and invest it won't give you too many taxes but if, otherwise, you are unlucky and you don't have money to spend or sources to sell, you are condemned to a miserable life. Finally, i want to make clear that I don't`t consider myself a capitalist, nor a communist, because I`m always on the side of democracy, freedom of speech,the search for happiness and equality.",-1
9,"Communism gives the opportunity to live equally. No poverty, poor, Etc. In a Capitalist country, You take from the poor, and give to the rich, which creates Capitalist Classes (Rich, Poor). In a fascist country, the ruler can destroy things, sort of like Capitalism but economically. Communism shows equality for all, and does not destroy others.",-1
9,"Although I'm not very deeply educated in the world of politics and am not very interested in it, from what I understand communism is about equality, everyone works for the greater good of everyone, while capitalism is basically a free-for-all situation. Only those lucky and powerful enough can succeed in capitalism while in communism everyone owns everything. Communism is looked upon negatively because of the countries that use it are usually enemies of the allied forces, but in my opinion communism can be perfect if executed correctly. China and Korea are bad examples of how communism should be performed, Russia is a better example although not perfect, Russia does have a corrupt government but that isn't because of communism, no matter what system you use you can always have a corrupt government. Look at mexico for and example. In Russia everyone isn't cut off from the internet or has curfews and is super gritty and everyone is miserable or any of those misconceptions of communism shown through media.",-1
9,"Communism is fair, everyone is equal and their are less problems with society. The problem is that their are some people who strove to be the best and others who would rather sit and watch to all day. it's human nature and it is down in both forms of government I would say that communism work better but has flaws but less than capitalism.",-1
9,"Communism provides shelter, food, water, etc. making it possible to live without fear of starving, while with Capitalism, you have a chance of being poor, hungry, thirsty, etc. but you have a chance of being rich, well beloved, and a success in life but it's too much of a risk. Communism takes fear away. Capitalism either brings fear or not. Communism believes in equality. In capitalism, the rich gets richer, the poor gets poorer.",-1
9,"Because americans want to enter every country and do whatever the hell they want ""for america's security "" they say yeah invading every country in the world is called world domination is bad ,capitalism influences america's behavior , because the idea of capitalism is having more and more and more and not just in money but in land",-1
9,"Take the USSR for example. The top government officials wanted power, and therefore the whole concept of communism is ruined. If you have a selfish dictator, then of course your country will fail. In a true communist society, everyone is equal and their are no classes. This allows for less envy of those who have less money than others.",-1
9,"The most commonly used arguments against communism are that 'it's been tried and it didn't work', 'it is against human nature' and ' I AM AMERICAN SO YEAH, REASONS!' Excluding the last one, that was a joke, but their are people like that who would argue in that way. People who state that it 'doesn't work' clearly have not don't enough research. The reason why the Soviet Union fell is because it wasn't true communism. It left out many of the important rules for communism. This happened because the people who wanted communism, also wanted to be dictators and to have lots of power. So the rules that restrict this were terminated, leaving a false version of communism left over. If you use the argument about it being 'against human nature', consider what is wrong with that. If it is against human nature, then good, for evolution, things can't always stay the same, so if we do things against our nature, our nature will change for the better. Human nature right now is inherently flawed. Most governments are Kakistocracy, and we are naturally violent. Just as a side note, not everyone is poor in communism, everyone will have property about as good as the average wage British man. See ya, capitalist fools!",-1

9,"Capitalism was the system that helped minorities like the Jews to flourish and it liberated the peasantry and ended feudalism in under 100 years. It also increased the quality of life in many communist nations after the fall of the Soviet Union and the CCP wouldn’t survive if it didn't libralised. Compare free healthcare in Chile and Cuba both have free healthcare but Chile is a lot richer. What’s the difference between Venezuela and Sweden, Sweden is more capitalist than Venezuela.",1

It defies human nature for a better free life. While in America you can say as you please, Do as you please so long as you don't hurt anyone, Or destroy property. Biggest is even a fast food wage everyone complains about can feed you well, And get you a care. Yes big corporations exists, And they do exploit, But competition helps keep wages higher. it's not perfect, But even the poorest are rich compared to the poor in communism.",1

Is Peter going to want to produce 50 apples again? Why should he, Right? Why should he shed the blood, Sweat, Tears, And resources to produce 50 apples any longer, When BY LAW, 10 of his apples are now REQUIRED to belong to Paul? Communism is ABSOLUTELY COUNTER-LOGICAL AND COUNTER-INTUITIVE! The indomitable spirit of Man is to DREAM and ASPIRE to BETTER him or herself to an UNLIMITED degree NOT BOUNDED OR CAPPED with LIMITATIONS!

But as you get older, Things will start to even out because if the rich kid doesn't work to keep their money and the poor kid works hard well, Guess who's gonna be the rich one. I know communism might work and sound good in theory. Everyone works, Everyone benefits, No wage gaps, Ect. It doesn't work well in the real world. Here's some issues I find with communism. 1. It hasn't worked before. it's been tried many times and doesn't work out so I don't want to be part of something with a long list of failure. 2. Your not motivated to work. If bob over their is putting 1/2 the effort you are but you get paid the same, Why would you work this hard. Just barely work at all and still get paid. 3. You not really rewarded for hard work. If I work my butt off, I'm not gonna get a rise, Plain and simple. Why would I waste time on learning to be a doctor if I'm not gonna get paid well? Here are something I like about capitalism: 1. I get what I worked for. If I worked for 40 hours while Pat worked 20 hours, I'm gonna get paid more (unless it's salary based but if I get what I need to don't, And Pat doesn't then I'm still getting paid more) 2. It creates better quality everything. Companies will fight each other for a better product at a cheaper price. That's really good for a consumer. Also, As mentioned in #1, Employees will work hard to get paid, So what they do will be better as well. 3. It just overall allows for more liberties. I really support citizens getting as much control over their life as possible, As long as it doesn't invade another life. Communism will restrict things like that. Live And Let Life People!",1
9,their are over 250 countries in the World and yet only 4 are communist and they include tiny states such as Laos and Cuba as well as North Korea. Doesn't sound like a group of nations to admire and copy. Case closed; capitalism wins the days now and for all time.,1
9,"Read the title. Would you rather live in North Korea, Communist China, and Soviet Russia, or the United States, Canada, and the UK? there are many reasons why, although sounding great in theory, communism never works. It is because it requires a perfect society where no one commits any crimes for the sake of human greed, and everyone stays content doing what others tell them. Capitalism works because people are inherently greedy. Those who work hard and reach for the stars will climb the social ladder, and those content with flipping burgers will stay where they are. No one can be jealous. Imagine you work at an office 60 hours a week. You always keep your nose to the grindstone at work, and everyone likes you, but because you'll never get a promotion or a raise. Why? Because Joe downstairs in the mailroom needs to get paid a fair salary too, but you have to keep trying your absolute hardest at work. Otherwise, the system will fail. In short, people quickly lose motivation to work and become extremely lazy. there isn't enough money. The government cannot continue to support you forever. They have to get money from somewhere, and if they don't allow for private corporation, who do they tax? Where does the money come from that the government can keep paying for social services? Eventually, with free travel and global inflation, the currency will lose all value and the country will slip into poverty. But, at least you all get to fall into the bottom 20% together, so it's not so bad right?",1
9,"Capitalism is a good way to multiply your possible income from your job. Speaking of jobs, you may not even get to choose your job with communism.

People starve and the government controls everything. Our founding fathers wanted us to be free, not under control by some wacko government official who won't let you advance in society and, as a result, you are stuck making 3 bucks an hour saving someone's life, while the guy next door is sleeping on the job and still making 3 bucks an hour. Result, I starve. I die. Government takes all my dough and spends it on itself. (I might be thinking about socialism, but it's all evil at the end of the day.)

9,"Communism only works in theory; it's impossible to apply to the real world because of human nature.

When the soviet-afghan war happened the Americans funded the Islamic Mujahideen with weapons and billions of dollars and funding which they turned out to be al-Qaeda and declared war on America under the name Osama bin Laden they soviets job was to stop them from taking over Afghanistan so technically America funded terrorism against themselves and I have never seen communism fund terrorism against themselves,1

9,there are times when a communist economic approach works better than capitalism and there are times when it does not. Having said that the natural state of economics is straight capitalism. If communism is tried as a permanent economic system then an authoritarian government must be installed to enforce the rules of communism and let's face it that's just not good for anyone.,1

9,The reason communism isn't fair is because the people that work hard don't get paid the way they should. If I work hard I should get paid more than the person who didn't work hard. Capitalism promotes hard work and people benefit from working hard. Communism suggests that if i work 9 hours a day and another person works 5 hours a day we should get paid the same amount which is not fair.,1

With high tax rates the government can spend more on healthcare,infrastructure,education and much more.",1
9,"AN ARGUMENT AGAINST COMMUNISM. I saw someone here say that Communism is a more free democracy, however this is not true because in a Communist state everything is controlled by the government and if that government is corrupt (Like Soviet Russia) everyone is poor and the only happy people are the Chairmen. Communism provides no incentive to go to work, in a society that gives ""free"" money nobody wants to get a job or go to work (see the people abusing welfare?) and if nobody makes money their ""contributions"" to go into the commonwealth will not be much and if this continues until the point where nobody works the whole system falls apart (you can't just print money to give to everyone it all comes from taxpayers).",1

But communism will give them the same payment, for 2 different jobs. Or a soldier. Someone who is willing to sacrifice him/herself for their country, and their close ones. They would get the same payment as a janitor too. I'm just saying, communism is stupid, and it does not reward people who want to work, whilst rewarding lazy people.",1
9,"Communism is a great idea, but only in theory. there are many flaws with Marx's theories, and those flaws have actually benefited us and capitalism. First of all, communism doesn't apply to human nature. Every human has the same need for resources, and as much as possible. Imagine this: a communist society, with 2 men having the same job. One man is working his butt off trying to get the pay he needs, while the other man sleeps on the job. They both get the same pay. Does that sound fair? Now, I have another flaw for you commies, and it's one that I haven't seen mentioned from either side of the argument: competition. In capitalism, there are many companies selling the same product to as many people as possible. In fact, their is even a law to prevent monopolies in the USA. I have another anecdote for you, actually. Imagine this: 2 companies are selling computers to the market. The first one sells a brand-new lightweight computer for only $2,000. People are attracted to this new product, and business is drawn away from the second company. In response, company #2 decides to 1-up company #1, by building a hand-held, powerful supercomputer for $1,000. Now company #1 is losing money. As you can see, competition benefits us, with more features and lower costs for products. I have an example to show how this would work in communism, with a monopoly for everything. I'm going to pick on Canada's healthcare system for this. Now don't get me wrong, it's great to have healthcare available to everyone. However, if people get free healthcare, then there isn't any competition. Without competition, you don't strive to become the best. That way, you can give crappy operations for a ridiculously high price, and nobody can switch because you're the only one with those operations! My final flaw does not point fingers at Marx, but instead the commies to the left of me. Some of you have said that the USSR fell because of capitalism, and that's true. However, you must consider this: if you lived in communism all your life, with everything you need to know being told to you, what would happen if that was suddenly taken away, with you, the inexperienced boss, controlling a business all on your own? People in the USSR did not know how to run a business, so when Gorbachev took their ability to follow orders away, they became children with the instructions for an IKEA chair. it's not easy suddenly adapting to immediate change. I rest my case, communism sucks.",1
9,"Capitalism is much better than Communism. In Capitalism, everyone who works hard will have a good time, and vice versa. In a Capitalist society, everyone has the opportunity to make money. The amount of money you make depends on how hard you work. In Capitalism, it is possible for everyone to be rich. Capitalism could save the United States economy, and bring us out of our debt once and for all. If you support Communism, it just shows that you are lazy, because you want to get payed the exact same amount as the hard working person. Capitalism is better by far.",1
9,"Communism is held up on the backs of those who have property. If you have property, communism dictates that it be taken from you. I you are lucky enough to be allowed to stay you will be told what to do with it. One example would be- you own a farm, the farm is taken from you, you are given a cow and told that that one cow is all you really need. You then have enough to survive on, but not to really live on.",1
9,"When the government imposes regulation on the economy, only the big businesses can afford it, this causes smaller competitors to go out of business and allows for big business to dominate, if the government is in bed with corporations then the solution isn't more government involvement with corporations, that is when you end up with corporate welfare and other distortions of the free market. Just look at China, thanks to Capitalism they have managed to lift millions out of poverty: Then look at Latin America, Venezuela has stuck to Socialism and despite having huge oil reserves it struggles to provide people with milk, flour and toilet paper. Whereas over in Capitalist Chile, who have virtually no resources, their people enjoy the 3rd highest living standards in the Americas, after the US and Canada Compare places like Hong Kong, who have virtually no resources to Cuba, who have an abundance of resources, before Castro's communism Cuba had a per capita income higher than that of both Spain and Portugal combined, now however the country is stuck in a 1950's timewarp, Castro himself has admitted that Communism is a failure. Just like Cuba, Hong Kong was under an embargo from it's closest neighbour, China, back then it was just a shanty town, after Capitalism it tops the lists for highest qualities of life and prosperity Just compare Stalinist North Korea to Capitalist South Korea, who have produced Samsung, Hyundai, LG and countless other companies whereas North Korea has produced record starvation, concentration camps and a line of dictators. Socialists and Communists always use Scandinavia as an example of Socialism however Scandinavia only really became prosperous when it moved towards privatization and lower taxes: Communism is responsible for the deaths of 100 million people and some of the most brutal dictators such as Mao Zedong, Stalin, Lenin and other frankly satanic leaders.",1
9,"Communism bases itself in the labor value theory. The theory, created by Marx, says that the value of a product of a service depends on the amount of human labor needed to created that product of service. That goes against the supply and demand theory, which says the value of a product or service comes shifts by it's supply and demand. The consequence of basing prices on the labor value instead on supply and demand is scarcity and surplus in every aspect of the economy. The production is never in equilibrium. That's why communism fails.",1
9,"So far to date. Every communist country is a failed state. All Communist states have fallen already. With China slowly shifting its economy to a more superior capitalist economy. Therefore have seen sporadic growth in the last 2 decades. While on the other hand. The policies of Communism have created mass famines that have killed millions in China, Soviet Union and in North Korea. it's closed market system discourages trade, and as a result lower standards of living. However, what I have since talked about is only practiced communism and not the 'perfect communism' you guys are talking about. Communism in theory will indefinitely create a equal society. In a society where all is equal, will people study and work to their fullest potential? Will Scientists and government officials work harder if their pay were the same as a plumber? If they don't feel recognised by the society, they will lack the motivation to work to their fullest potential. The perfect communism destroys opportunities, the dreams and goals of children and the hard work that can be produced in a competitive environment like capitalism. Even though Capitalism packs a lot of flaws as well. Communism will result in a dead society that will lack any ability to tackle future issues that they have not surfaced before.",1
9,"Capitalism is better than communism. Capitalism allows people to choose what career to have. Some people might think that having your job given to you by the government is better because they would know best what you would be good at. This is not true because even if you are good at the job they give you, you will not put nearly as much effort in to it compared to a job that you chose your self. If you want visual examples of communism vs. Capitalism go to New York city USA with Google earth then look at communist Vietnam or North Korea.",1
9,"Communism was an idea created by Karl Marx in the 1800s in a time when the upper class ruled everything and the lower class ruled nothing. Communism, a system of government that made everyone equal, sounded ideal and very good at the time. However, when the Soviet Union was created, it was discovered that this system does not work in practice. The government ends up ruling over everything and the people all live with almost nothing. Capitalism isn't perfect, but I think it more promotes hard work and prevents the government from becoming too large and taking over everything.",1

Everyone wants to improve their state of living, and although it is difficult to do that in capitalism, it is outright impossible to do it in true communism.",1
9,"First of all, the government should not be involved in the free trade of society at all, AKA. Laissez-faire. A government should never have enough power to control the means of production, supply and demand. Honestly, socialism (while I still prefer capitalism) is a much better idea. Communism requires elitism, because you can't enforce a classless society if no one is enforcing it. Instead of the government being headed by Bourgeois who believe they are elite because they have decided to take a leadership position, the community (or society) elects to be classless and have everything equal, while still keeping a democratic system to elect leaders of the community.",1
9,"Marx's ideas were very creative. Communism looked great on paper, but in reality it doesn't work. How do we know? Look at history. While I believe Communism can be worse for other nations, in general it doesn't work.

We see a pattern of Communist leaders' repressive behavior on their people. (IE Lenin, Stalin, Castro, Kim Jong, etc)",1

9,"As you can see, in communism, everyone is paid equally, so even if I don't try hard in a communist economy, I still get the same paycheck. In a capitalist economy, people are encouraged to work hard because you get paid more for doing a better job, like you get more money for working hard, and you get fired if you do a crummy job.",1
9,"The very citation of the words Marx, a man who wrote his manifesto while receiving aid from a capitalist friend (Engels) lends a sort of irony to your argument. Having seen and experienced the results of communism first hand, I can say that it is nothing more than a bloated pipe dream of man who was dissatisfied with the results of his life. It was communism, and it's close cousin progressivism, that perpetuate the falsehood of classes. It is part of the human condition to have rich and poor. their cannot be equal outcomes for everyone, and if you were to use the argument that all men are created equal to further your aims, you would be doing a disservice to that truth. We may be created equal, but it is what we do from their that makes us different. To accept a core tenet of communism-that we should limit the ability for people to excel because it would create a disparate gap between them and others-would doom a society to end up at a mathematical truth, the lowest common denominator. As my experience has been, that lcd always trends towards it lowest state of being. Capitalism, or more specifically free enterprise, allows for the full potential of human capital to be released due to its inherent nature. Sure, some will fail while others succeed, but that accents the beauty and superiority of the system over communism. Each man is able to make the most, or little, of what he has instead of being subjected to the whims of a supposedly omniscient core of central planners. In summary, when man's economic potential has been unleashed under capitalism, the results have been staggering. Communism, on the other hand, stymies our economic potential bt the very constraints it purports to release us from.",1

9,"It has been known in history that living conditions of Communist nations have been very poor! Communism introduced a system in which there are no classes, meaning there is no class warfare. Now this sounds good and all, but let's look at it a different way. Communism has a one party system, meaning that there is only one group of people that gets to rule the country, and all who oppose them will DIE. Communism is the epitome of oppression, and should be delegated in the law of all mankind that even though we are created equal we can never ""be"" equal. Communism is BAD, Capitalism is slightly less BAD.",1

When it runs out, it doesn't even be classified as Communism anymore, most countries change to a fascist government, so more resources can be conserved.",1

They've become more and more capitalist over the past few decades. Hardly communist at all. And you know what? The more capitalist they become, the better their life have become. In principle, the freedom to invest in your estate and make financial growth off it is simply better. The Government is not financially competent enough to manage the economy themselves. List one nation to prove Communism works (a list of 0). I'll respond with a much much larger list of Capitalist nations that did better (all of them.)",1
9,"Communism has never worked. there is no good reason that the government should own everything and ration it out how they please. Communism doesn't want less poor people, they want less rich people. there has never been a single communist society that didn't have a horrible condition of living for the poor. Even when the USSR was still instated, they would use the movie the grapes of wrath as a propaganda tool to show the citizens poor people living in a capitalistic society, but it backfired on them because the citizens of the USSR were astounded that even the poorest people in a capitalist society still were able to afford cars. All societies will have people who are poorer than others, period. The difference is that with capitalism, you get to redefine what poor is. For instance, in the USA, the poverty line is on average any household that makes less than 20K a year, which is more than the middle class makes in many other countries, especially communist ones. Also, it is a place where a millionaire and someone who is unemployed have a high chance of having the exact same phone. there's a reason communism has never worked.",1

It always try to restrict people who actually contribute to the economy in order to grab more power for itself. That's communism and based on historical evidence, Communism never works.",1
10,"Large corporations have worked for and earned the money that they have received in profits. If they are charging too high, Few people will buy their products. If they abuse workers, No one will work their. If they harm the environment, People will boycott their products. If they deceive customers and investors, They will lose customers and investors. Because of this, Corporations have been shaped into what the people want. Corporations are not entitled to be governmental puppets, They can make their own decisions and control their own affairs. The government needs not to step in and make them good companies, Demand and pressure from the citizens ensure that already. One thing people might say is that companies exploit workers, But that is the workers’ own fault for not being aware enough to find another job. there is nothing unethical about using another’s vulnerabilities to your advantage, It’s all fair competition. Another thing they say is that it causes wealth inequality but America is a diverse country, Meaning not everyone have equal abilities and not everyone can succeed. If you are poor, Blame yourself and not your boss. If you are poor, Get yourself out of poverty through hard work, Not sit around waiting for damn liberals. More regulations means more harm for companies and it’s unhealthy for international competition, Especially with China. Capitalism is different from feudalism because you don't just inherit your wealth - you earn it. This is why the government should stop being so envious of entrepreneurs’ many successes. Instead, It should go regulate itself, Seeing as it currently has trillions in debt.",1
10,"They should not regulate business practices because businesses need to make it on their own. They need to figure out what works for them, And what does not work for them.

I believe that businesses should be able to regulate themselves in their jobs not others.",1
10,"Less regulation leads to a more open flexible economy. Also because then companies have to compete to keep workers and compete for sales of goods. If there is no regulation then the economy can never worry about being forced to one standard. If the government gets involved then they charge higher taxes and impose work regulations causing spending cuts and Job cuts. Therefore a government hands free economy is more competitive and will be stronger will better jobs, More jobs, And more overall consumer competition.",1

10,"As someone who has studied economics, I realize the consequences of government regulations on businesses and possible employees. The truth is that government regulations are EXPENSIVE to businesses and the outcomes of this can be catastrophic. For example, when businesses are trying to be in line with these regulations they have to invest a lot of time and money to suit those changes and in the process have to cut spending. So, people start to lose their jobs because of these regulations. When people have to be paid higher wages, it leads to more people losing their jobs because small businesses especially, cannot afford to take on these wages. What I have learned from economics is, the economy functions at it's best when it works on it's own. The free market knows what price is the best and they have the ability to break down monopolies through competition. Government regulations in a free economy don't work unless there are extreme circumstances and I believe that businesses should have the ability to function on their own.",1
10,"Regulations should be cut because if a business is regulated, it would need to pay for the regulations, which in turn increases the price consumers have to pay. This makes people not want to participate in the United States of America's market. Also, it generates ""tape"" and reduces world competitiveness.",1
10,The government is going to control our business anyways. They control it enough as is and shouldn't control it more than what they are now. They need to back off some more and maybe everyone wouldn't be mad that they are taking money and trying to make us pay for things we don't need.,1
10,"Let the free market off its leash. Capitalism needs to be let loose and not restricted by government. I understand laws preventing companies from doing harm to employees, but people are not forced to stay at that job. People have the right to make their own choices and don't need government making these choices for them. I feel that the Government is basically everybody' s parents telling them what to do and how to do it. If a company has horrible employee policies then people will work somewhere else, meaning that company won't have any employees to run the business, meaning it will fail. Logic over emotion.",1
10,If the government where to strep in and give small businesses money it would get rid off work effort and no one would try any more because the government is giving them money. If the government were to step in and give money to the poor and people in general then money would become useless because everybody has it which would cause a money inflation and every thing would become overly expensive making another great depression.,1

Government is the cause of all of our problems. their is plenty of evidence that regulation stagnates growth and that if government interferes with free market mechanisms then lots of suffering occurs. there was a depression before the great depression but nobody remembers it because it was temporary. The reason it ended so quickly was because when it started the government didn't do anything and let the market correct itself. The great recession was caused by central banking. Historically free banking (not wildcat banking) worked well in lots of places using clearing house associations that would run the interbank payment system and act as a lender of last resort for its member banks. For clearing house associations to allow a bank to obtain membership it had to allow the clearing house association to audit it's books, follow clearing house rules, and contractually agree to accept each others banknotes and tokens at face value using the same measurement of units of account agreed by every bank in the world with a contractual obligation to redeem a certain amount of units of account for a gold and silver coin and private mints would produce bullion. Combine this with pure laissez faire capitalism and pure anarcho-capitalism with private rating agencies for product safety without any rules regulations or government intervention and a good justice system that protects property rights and require anyone who damages an area that is not part of their property to pay for the loss of property value plus a penalty and the cost of clean up and repairs and lots of injury compensation if anyone is injured. their shall not be any regulations and all parties shall be responsible to ensure safety and this method will ensure maximum safety.

10,"their is a basic misconception about businesses that is incredibly clear in the arguments for government regulation. People think that businesses can force people to do things. That is completely untrue; the whole point of government is to stop coercion. there are two methods people can use to get what they want: holding a gun to the other person's head (coercion) or offering them something in exchange (business). The governments stops coercion from happening, so the only way to effectively get what you want is using business. In order for a trade to take place, both sides must be happy with it- you are not going to spend $1,000 on a pile of leaves. Therefore, in order for a business to function, it must please both its customers (who buy the goods), and it's workers (who will spend their time on other things if they don't think the job is worth it). However, in a capitalist government there is one entity that can exercise force- the government itself. As soon as you introduce the government into any situation, you plant coercion in the system. Take the example of health care: in the past, one could simply abandon a health care plan and have negligible adverse consequences. However, if one abandons a government health care plan, one must pay $695 a year. Government economic regulations take away vital the vital freedom to choose the best option.",1
10,"What government regulations do the economy is horribly destructive. Uplifting regulations, eliminating corporate welfare, and disabling corporations from dominating industries, you will enable small businesses to develop better and for corporations to face competition that keeps them at pay. This allows for a more pro-consumer society wherein the output of commodities increases with 1) the profit incentive and 2) the stimulation of the economy by allowing small businesses with natural products to combat corporations with artificial, processed foods. For instance, a small family-owned bakery with fresh bread will likely sell more than a corporation with processed wheat or flour in a free market. Why? Because their commodities are fresher, have better quality, and thus fulfill the basis of 'supply and demand' in the basic economics of laissez-faire. But regulations also are the reason corporations 1) ship jobs overseas and 2) corporations continue expanding. The government regulating big business causes them to invest in labor in other nations where sweatshop conditions are normal, and where women and children are starving in horribly-conditioned factories. Why? Because they don't have to pay so much to their workers if they have people getting wages of $0.30/hr as opposed to those they have to pay at least $7.25/hr min. To the workers in the homeland (U.S). Now, to explain the corporate expansion principles under regulated capitalism: not only can corporations ship job overseas and monopolize over foreign soil, but they can also put money into the political process to use Washington as their piggy bank. Therefore, if the government is 'hands-off' on business, and vice versa, because laws were established for it, we would have a much more effective system wherein businesses cannot effectively expand to high rates without being fair to workers through wages and labor conditions.",1
10,"What's wrong with regulations? It causes outsourcing and America has lost 2.4 million jobs to China since 2001 because of it. The question is, why is that? It is a lot more complex than just that fact that we have a high minimum wage. China has devalued their currency to increase the amount of large corporations that move from American, as well as other countries, into China. Furthermore, America has the highest corporate income tax at 35%; this is the reason why apple makes their products in China and not California. Capitalism is not very malleable, when you add in all kinds of regulations you start to see its ability to work decrease. Democrats like to try and fix that problem by adding more regulations, the fundamental issue with that is that what they are really doing is tightening the belt that is around America's metaphorical neck.",1
10,"In somewhat recent memory, the last Laissez-Faire Presidents we had were Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. their is a little known fact, that when Harding took office he inherited a major recession, that could have turned into a Depression. However, Harding's Laissez-Faire principles, and idea of a non-interventionist Government got The Nation out of the struggle, and gave us the most prosperous period in United States History. Coolidge, of course, continued this. However, Coolidge declined to run again, and one of his cabinet members, Herbert Hoover became president in 1929. They call him a ""Laissez-Faire Capitalist"", yet refuse to acknowledge his wage control policies, and his massive tax hikes. This next is key. Hoover's Presidency included the 1929, Stock Market Crash. For those who believe the crash caused The Depression, it is a complete farce. The REACTION, of The United States Government, which was tax and spend, spiraled The Country further down. Of course, after Hoover, we got Roosevelt, who prolonged the Depression through World War II. This is another unacknowledged fact. there's a reason why The Economy nearly went down again after World War II, and it was because of the fact that the regulatory ""Capitalism"" failed.",1

""Laissez-Faire"" capitalism and ""regulated"" capitalism ultimately come up with the same result, but in different ways: socio-economic failure. there is no effectiveness for the common man under capitalism, there is only effectiveness for the bourgeoisie.

From the first gilded age in the united states to the destruction to lives and rights in the southern cone by Milton Friedman Chicago Boys to the criminal Greenspan's admission of a ""flaw"" in his model over and over again we see the failure of the efficient market junk theology.

But if you were incapacitated or in an emergency, you'd hope the person looking after you has at least gone to medical school. And if that person hasn't, well too bad.

We should impose regulations to stop things that harm the nation. That said, the trade deals and economic system of the United States today have lots of problems and are not the way the economy should be regulated.

11,"A lot of misconceptions exist about socialism. The most common one is that lazy people will be given money for doing nothing. This is absolutely false. One of the defining features of socialism is that people are rewarded according to their contribution because they own the company they work at. In capitalism shareholders get benefits without producing anything in the company they own. All the shareholders did was invest money they earned earlier. Capitalism enables you to invest a single dollar and make it a thousand dollars without working; socialism gives the thousand dollars to the people who did the hard work of increasing their company's value by a factor of 1000. SOCIALISM REWARDS HARD WORK, CAPITALISM DOES NOT. Another common misconception is that socialism eliminates markets. These two are completely compatible. Markets are great because they circumvent any inefficiencies that come with a planned economy. Socialism doesn't prevent economic freedom as far as prices go. In socialism, all employees own part of the company's means of production, rather then just shareholders- this has never been don't before. Much of the failures of Socialist systems come from the fact that usually these governments are centralized dictatorships. A decentralized democratic socialist economy has not really been tried.

Capitalism has somehow gotten the idea that it is fit to run unchecked while all proof point to the fact that it repeatedly can't control itself, even to not consume itself. there's a place for capitalism in the world, but it is not in human rights and welfare.

11,"In a good socialist society, it's the society/Government which is the main employer. The employee will be paid in proportion to quality and quantity of the outputs and work. On the contrary, in a 'best' capitalistic structure, it is a single person (or a small group of people) of a firm dictate whom to employ or whom not to. It turns out most often, that the capitalist(s) or their henchmen are poorly qualified then the employee. Also consider share/stock market. Such dunces do no meaningful work but can earn fortunes for life. At the same time the workmen toil hard in a field or in a laboratory/workplace. it's well known that in capitalism some amass monstrously high income and it encourages 'live and let die' attitude. Without certain band of equality (in income, for example), their can be no equal opportunity to all (absolute equality may not be achievable even in a socialist country, though). In other words capitalism, especially of a large scale, is unjustifiable. True, socialism made some big blunders in the past (but it does not mean capitalism is error-free). But socialism gave several successes too. their is a need to reorganize our economic setup and embrace socialism. The mistakes and blunders etc. of the past must not be repeated. For example, there should be a rule something the United States has (a President can serve for not more than two terms). And the powers of head of a country should also have reasonable limits.",-1

How is it fair that the Government is able to tell private citizens how their property will be managed? The only thing Socialism gives is an equal share of misery. Socialism breeds black-markets. Black markets breed criminals. If I risk my resources as an investor, why is it fair to distribute any profit with those who have risked nothing? Under socialism the individual is meat for the grinder, and most are made to suffer ""for the greater good"". I've got 1 life to live, and want to enjoy it to the extent my abilities allow. How is it fair am I obligated to have my production subject to theft? If I work 100 hours a week, year over year, decades after decade, so I can retire early, and enjoy my life, how is it fair to have that effort neutralized?

If I work at a restaurant, I don't deserve to earn the same benefits as someone who is worked their butt off to get to the top of a CEO position. Everyone should have equal opportunity, but shouldn't be handed things, or have to share with someone who simply doesn't work hard to get out of their situation.

In this case things like being a single parent of 7 or a bachelor are not taken into account; only your actual contribution (measured against the paying capabilities) to your clients.

A communist government or even a socialist government (which Hitler ran) has all the power.

11,"The totalitarian aspect is enough to drive me away. it's insane. Equality is good, but TOO much is just wrong! We need that drive to get us forward in life. Remember Animal Farm? We learned a good lesson from that. Leaders can easily take advantage of us. Imagine your next door neighbor getting the same pay bagging groceries while you're a mathematical astronomer. NOBODY will have the drive to do anything important for our society such as electrical engineering when they can work at a grocery market. See what I'm getting at about too much equality?",1
11,"Realistically, putting aside the practice of Communism in the real world, on paper, Communism actually isn't that bad and in fact it sounds good. However as history and the modern world has shown, Communism is possibly one of the worse political systems ever devised, arguably worse than Fascism. Communism in the USSR, China, North Korea, Southeast Asia, Cuba, and other parts of the world has led to more deaths then both world wars and every war the United States has ever fought combined. It is estimated that under Stalin, roughly 50-60 million people (so many people that mass graves are still being located in Eastern Ukraine and Siberia today) were killed by the Communist regime. Thousands more were locked up in gulags and concentration camps (for the practice of forced labor and starvation, the Communists are just as guilty as the Nazis). Thousands of Cubans and Vietnamese fled their nations in fear of the rise of Communism during the Cold War and many Cubans continue to flee Cuba still to this day. Mao Zedong, the Communist dictator of China from 1949- approx. 1975 is believed to have murdered upwards of 70-80 million people. Communism uses the guise of equality to hide it's aspects of oppression and tyranny.",1
11,"Communism is bad, Because if there's a taxi driver, And a doctor, Then they get paid the same for their passion. In the real world, If doctors get 6 years of school, And taxi drivers get maybe 1 week, Then the doctors will quit and just become a taxi driver, Or something else with no schooling. People will suffer having no doctors, Or something like that.",1
11,The government owns literally everything. You can't own anything. If you start a company then the government automatically owns it. You can't have anything against communism because then you will get punished. Only the people in the communist party gets to share all the good stuff while the rest of the people lives in pain and terror caused by the insane government.,1
11,"Communism is inherently ""sharing"" things of value equally among all people in society. there are two problems with this, firstly people don't produce things in equal amounts, and secondly people don't need things in equal amounts. So to solve the 'problem' of unequal production someone has to take from those who produce more and redistribute to those who don't produce as much (or at all). This creates a problem, firstly in the taking part of communism. Taking from someone, especially what they have produced, creates resentment between the taker and the producer. Second, when distributing these goods and services to the needy, then the producers will resent the needy as well, this creates a divide. The needy on the other hand, will have resentment for the producers, whom they view as oppressors, and will demand the goods and services that they receive. The communist system creates a cultural divide, it does not heal them. Finally, there is no way to systematically decide who gets what. What services are to be redistributed? Wealth? Ok fine. How about children, why not them? It is unfair that some people have many children and other people don't have to care for any. Why not healthcare? What if there are not enough surgeons to go around? Who gets operated on and who does not? there is no way to decide. If we are sharing goods and services equally everyone gets an incision, and the cancer remains inside. If you are lucky, you might get sutured back up again. So the basic problems with communism comes from the inequality that is inherent in reality. Forcing people to have equal outcome, equal possessions and equal wealth makes for a terribly imbalanced society. We want the rich to be intelligent and hard working, so that they have the resources to produce the things that they need to. Artists and entrepreneurs should be able to be funded and supported by the qualities of their ideas by investors who willingly buy into their company, innovations and art. Inequality of outcome is good, because each individual person is different and has different desires and goals. Once we are all communist, we will all be equally poor, and equally unhappy.",1

11,"Fact is that Communism, In order to work, Requires mass murder and even genocide. Humans are not the same, And therefore cannot be equal. Attempting to achieve complete equality will inevitably lead to oppression, Mass murder, And eventually genocide. If left alone, People will naturally differentiate. In order to achieve equality, One has to institute totalitarian control and oppression - but this leads to resistance, Which then causes a feedback loop where oppression and resistance reinforce each other, Ultimately resulting in mass murders, Pogroms and genocides.",1

Before communism existed, The far right never was in existence. It was only until Robespierre and all those other revolutions happened that communism was in motion. Therefore yes, Communism is bad it is the root of all evil. For you snowflakes who will be triggered, Cry me a river and get over it or go kill yourself.

11,"Karl Marx had an illness called ""Hidradenitis Suppurativa"" which caused boils and blisters in the apocrine sweat glands (found in the armpits and groins) which caused immense pain and inflammation. It also caused paranoia which was the main influence in his writings on communism. In conclusion the ""communist manifesto"" were writings of illogical garbage by a clinically ill man who was suffering from paranoia. And as a result communism ""when it was applied"" showed how illogical it was. And the whole ""it wasn't applied correctly"" argument is invalid due to the fact that communism is the control of government by the people and when communism came into fruition in Russia, China, etc. it was started by the ""people"" revolting against the monarchy/government. Communism does not work and those who say that it was applied wrong don't want to accept the fact that the ideology that they believe in is wrong. Communism is the religion of the state; it's just as misguided as the religion of the spirit",1
11,"The idea of Communism is beautiful indeed, and Karl Marx was the lucid sign of a genius, perhaps the greatest light of the 19th century. The letters concealed within his most revered literary work, ""The Communist Manifesto,"" forever changed the course of mankind. But don't be fooled into believing that Communism goes any more far than just a beautiful idea; for we now know, through past events and the lesson of history that it is impossible for Communism to function. I say this, not because I am a pessimist, but because in the simpler past, where men were not exposed to phones, televisions, or cars, Communism failed. Who know, among us, will give up their phones? Will give up their cars? Will give up their own homes so that the lower class may enjoy the reaps of your (supposed) hard labor? If that is you, don't hesitate to comment ""aye."" Still, I scarce believe I will find such foolish comment of ""aye."" Communism is the idea that states, or for better, obliges you to state: ""I will give up all I have for the betterment of one who never worked or in any other way attempted to superb himself."" And so, because too little to none will say this, Communism has no pillar in which to lay it's ton. Who will break their spines, who among you, to pillar and bear the weight of all who are truly lazy? Who among you will do so, comment ""aye."" And even then, I shall not find such foolish comment of ""aye."" Why? Because even after we all (supposedly) agree to such fallacy, which of course, shall never happen, their still lies the basic concept of utter anarchy. In order to be a true Communism, a Communism that is true to the ideas of the brilliant Marx, and Marxist Communism, then the government must not rule over the citizen. Why? Because in this situation, the politicians in the government will all have more land, more wealth, and more social influence then the common citizen. Who among you will accept and utter anarchy? Then, comment ""aye.""",1
11,I need help understanding what communism really is and if it's bad or good. Would it work to have the whole world be united under one communist government? How does it all work out for equality and stuff like that? Personally we need to eliminate every government and create a whole new worldwide government,-1
11,Communism as never actually been tried out as very few nations have even attempted to create it. While certain fascist nations have called themselves communist anybody who has studied their regimes and hase even a basic understanding of communist theory will immediately recognize that they were not even trying to be communist.

Perhaps in the distant future when the technology exists and the culture is right communism might actually be effective.,-1

Socialism is the stage that precedes communism, wherein the state socializes and nationalizes all means of production and redistributes capital equally. From each according to his ability to each according to his need. Communism is the stage where all of humanity unites into one entity, a collective wherein all individuals are subject to the interest of the collective (logical, seeing as they're part of it). In communism, all capital, all means of production are collective and shared.",-1
11,"Communism isn't bad, theoretically. Karl Marx and any others intended to create an economic system that would be equal for all. It would eliminate classes, and everyone would be happy. It had huge government, but a lot of people think large government is better, and Karl Marx was probably one of those people. When you think about it, that sounds a lot more fair and WAY better than capitalism, and even arguably pure socialism (let's not forget, though, that communism is kind of extreme socialism). Here's the problem: communism doesn't work. As we've seen in history - the Cold War, mainly - communism has always failed. In a way, communism is ""too good to be true"". A communist economy would not work in a capitalist-economy dominated world. Furthermore, communism has always been rigged. Yeah, capitalism (and even socialism... Maybe?) can easily be rigged too (just look at the current crisis we're having in the United States right now!), but communism can literally be used to create a brutal dictatorship and take control of everyone. Without using communism properly, it can lead to poverty rather than prosperity. Without democratic communism, it's going to be oppressive and pretty awful. Is democratic communism possible? Probably, it's just never happened. So how have countries like China, Cuba, North Korea, and others survived? For one, a few of the ""remaining communist countries"" aren't really pure communist anymore. China, for example, is considered ""socialist with Chinese characteristics"". They might claim to be communist, but they truly aren't. In NK's case, their entire country is in poverty (as far as we know), so clearly it hasn't worked for them. Cuba? I don't know much about it, but I imagine it's not purely communist anymore either. Although I don't think any communist states have this much luck, another factor could be (natural) resources within the country; it could just go isolationist. I like communism - the theory, but if I want to be realistic about it, I'd say apply democratic/market socialism to a controlled capitalist economy. Look at Europe and Scandinavia, they are doing it very well and it's making them pretty happy!",-1

You need some and you need to have it in a proper diet. You can't just blanket statement ""X is bad."" Communism has many good aspects and in certain scenarios, it can be very successful. Ideally, it must be small scale. The larger the scale, the less stability it can have. The people must also all be of a similar mindset. You can't impose communism on a group of 500 random people. But you can take 500 communists and leave them be, and they can be successful. there are numerous cases of long standing communes, ever here in the US. Of course, saying that it is not ""bad"" is not the same as saying, ""hey, let's turn the USA communist!""

It is hard to explain what communism is because it is so good, That no one can understand what it is, And this is why anti communists hate communism so much. They hate communism because they were raised emotionally to believe that real consciousness is offensive. They get offended when a woman is independent, And works hard. They get offended by divorce. Anti communists get offended by those who go against patriarchy. Anti communism is anti human. America is anti communist, So America is anti human.

11,"Communism isn't inherently bad, In fact a lot of these responses seem very, Very miseducated on the subject. For you see, As cliché as it may sound, Real communism hasn't ever been implemented. In the Communist Manifesto, Marx defines a communist state to be a state in which the means of production are communally owned, But alongside this the state would also be moneyless and classless. No supposed example of a communist state has satisfied the moneyless condition and thus the closest we've ever reached is socialism, Specifically an ideology known as Marxism-Leninism. I find capitalism's critique of communism quite strange in all honesty. Many of the replies here solely focus on the death tolls, And I don't blame them, The death tolls are scary. But what you need to keep in mind is that during the Cold War, The US wanted to make communism look as bad as possible, So to distract from communism's successes the CIA started funding publications like the China Quarterly, And started to back coups against socialist regimes like Thomas Sankara in Burkina Faso and Fidel Castro in Cuba. The death toll under ""communism"" needs to be looked at in context. Firstly, The deaths are very exaggerated, Particularly by sources like the black book of communism. Secondly, You need to look at the context of these deaths. Mao and Stalin didn't just go around willy nilly and kill millions and millions of people, there are varying reasons for these death tolls. The deaths in Second World War and famines due to natural disasters are examples of things people attribute to communism. The black book goes a step further and ludicrously tries to include things like deaths by car accident. My issue with this line of thinking is, People don't apply the same logic to capitalism. If you apply the same line-of-thinking and criteria that people due when it comes to these death tolls by communism on capitalism, it's a consensus that capitalism's death tolls are higher, And not just because there's many more examples of capitalist nations, Per capita too. Indian economist Utsa Patnaik concluded in a study she conducted in 2018 that in India alone between 1765 and 1938 1. 8 billion Indians starved to death due to the British Empire's capitalist policies that were otherwise preventable. Now, I'm not sure capitalism should be judged in this way, But by many of the replies to this debate if we ARE going to play the numbers game then capitalism walks it. it's not even close. I'm not denying that certain socialist states made mistakes, it's undeniable. But there are many examples of supposed socialist states that people point to today, Like Venezuela and China, In which in reality these countries are not socialist. I think every example of socialist states needs to be looked at objectively, Because these states had undeniable successes. China and the USSR went from poverty states to global superpowers in mere decades.",-1

Due to this no country is communist but SOCIALIST where it's a democracy where classes exist, people are associated with the job not money, mass censoring and has 1 supreme leader with a group of advisors.

11,"Yes, because socialism is more to do with the interest of the society as a whole- it is utilitarian. That does not mean that the interest of the individual is ignored. It advocates cooperation, which means we are more productive because we can pool our resources, expertise as well as take advantage of economies of scale and division of labour. It is not, as some claim, ‘equality’ or ‘statism’ (Marx was in fact against statism in his later works). Each person will be rewarded according to their contribution to the group as determined by the group. I appreciate that some capitalists advocate cooperation through the market, but socialists have decided to go one step further- we believe in cooperative and democratic management of production, because the workers are the boss- they are empowered and motivated as well as being given the responsibility, hence they become more productive. Capitalism I might add is the best system SO FAR. As much as attempts of socialism have failed in the last few centuries it is rather like how Thomas Edison said he found six hundred ways how not to invent a light bulb (though whether he did invent the light bulb is still disputed). The socialist bulb will, in my opinion, replace the capitalist lantern. Furthermore, I would like to say that the ‘failures’ of socialist places like the USSR have being blown out of proportion, while their advantages downplayed- the USSR had free schooling, free health care, free housing, job security, minimum wages and stable prices. No wonder many (though by no means all) eastern Europeans are nostalgic. But I'm still acknowledging the failures of socialism, as well as the fact that socialism is not perfect. I would like opponents to not appeal to authority by quoting Winston Churchill regarding ‘the virtues of socialism…vice of capitalism’. He was a great man and a true loyal fellow Briton. But I cannot ‘worship’ his views.",-1

11,"Socialism means 1000 things but if you are comparing it to capitalism, then understand you are now reducing it to an economic theory. Capitalism can be summed up as the private ownership of the means of production, and socialism contrasts with public ownership, which can take on different medium, most use government. That being the case these can be directly measured, and in the real world very few things are ""pure"" anything including systems, thus they operate on a spectrum. Here is one list measuring economic freedom as defined by private ownership of the means of production. While definitely not a perfect 1:1 relationship, I'd bet you'd choose countries that were closer to the top of the list then those at the bottom. Ideology is wonder, but it's application is important. If it takes angels to make a particular idea work, then chances are that the idea was not based to function under the human condition. Obviously arguments can be made that future technologies can make it happen but until I see the more socialistic leaning governments start gaining traction over the capitalistic leaning governments due to said technology. I'd say it's a rather safe conclusion that socialism is not overall better than capitalism as it stands in the early 21st century.",1

A majority of the millionaires and billionaires (not all, but most), got their riches from selling products, or assisting in the selling of products that have been overall beneficial. We have the best technological advantages, because those rich people are trying to find new ways to make better products for less money, so they can maximize their profit. In this scenario, there are no losers. They work hard because they have to make good products, or people will flock to their competition, and they'll go out of business. In socialism, their is very little progress, or sometimes even no progress at all, technologically. Because if there's no competition, then there's no incentive to innovate. Which means that technological advantages, medical advantages and so on, would be few and far between, or would more likely stop entirely. In essence, while capitalism sounds bad on the surface, while socialism feels better, capitalism in general helps way more people than socialism ever will. Anybody who believes that needs to research the USSR. I also think that people tend to overlook capitalism, because they assume all capitalism is cronyism, which is indeed a real problem, however most capitalism is not like that.",1
11,"Under a perfect socialist system where everyone is equal, an engineer will do way more technical work then a fast food worker, because the engineer has far more skill then the fast food worker will ever have. The problem is that under a perfect socialist system, the engineer will make exactly as much money as the fast food worker, because both are humans, and both have the same needs. That fast food worker will never have any incentive to be more productive or skilled since he will make the same no matter how little he actually does, and he'll still get fed, still get free healthcare, still get all the amenities provided to him as everyone else. Because there is no reward for doing anything extraordinary, scientific progress will cease because their is no reason to bother discovering anything new or inventing anything new. If the scientist could get paid the same amount twiddling his thumbs in his office as he gets paid to go the extra mile and put forth the effort to prove a theory works, chances are he's going to twiddle his thumbs.",1
11,"Capitalism is a system where workers are ruled by Tyrants known as bosses.These dictators keep most of the money the business makes, even though the employees do the real work. Reforms are offered to keep the workers from rebelling, but the bosses control the state through contributing their resources to political campaigns and often these reforms are empty. there are many workplaces around the world that are run democratically, without the dictatorial bosses. The workers will not truly thrive until they've taken biggest corporations under democratic, worker's control.",-1
11,"Yes, if you drive gas powered cars and voluntarily pay taxes. These are examples of social programs that your voluntary taxes support: public schools, roads, bridges, airports, trains, planes, oil, medicare, retirement plan=social security. Remember, the IRS tax system is entirely voluntary though you're threatened with audits if you don't pay after a few years, choosing to drive gas powered autos supports the transportation fund, choosing to fly supports the DHS, paying property taxes and/or supposedly playing the lottery helps public schools. We all do our fair share by choosing to support value add tax programs.",-1
11,"Is it likely someone's going to say 'I support it unwillingly'? Support is rather a belief system where someone has a desire or an emotional (or even rational) connection to something to hope that it succeeds (or at least does well). This belief system cannot be controlled apart from one's own mind. If they support something, it is because they want to support it (that is, they do so willingly). If someone does not want to support something, they can choose not to. there's not much controversy their. Of course, someone can vote for something at gunpoint. A person may put their 'X' beside Socialism on the ballot paper, but they don't support it. They've voted for it, but they haven't supported it because it's a mental activity that can't really be controlled by an external force (unless that external force influences them to change their mind, but that still depends on them changing their own mind. No one can change their mind for them. Only they have the power to change their own mind, but they can be open to influences.) So, in short, anyone can support anything willingly. No one can support something unwillingly. People can vote 'unwillingly', but they can choose not to support the thing they're forced to vote for. Support is a set of beliefs - it is a mental thing. No one can interfere with your belief system directly (indirectly, via influences, but not directly.) Your mind is your own.",-1
11,"It is about the people being able to take control through our representatives to makes sure that our interests and needs are met, rather than just the needs of a few people who have private money or power. It doesn't mean that absolutely everything has to be run by the government. Nor does it mean dictatorship. In fact dictatorship-run versions of socialism are false socialism. You can't have social ownership of the means of production through a non-democratic government. Dictatorship effectively means that a small privileged clique has control and not the people. Democratic socialism is the only true version of socialism. Many political scientists disagree that the United States is even a democracy anymore. Instead thanks to corporations bribing our politicians with contributions we are an oligarchy. But we don't have to remain an oligarchy. Even if our government is not a democracy or even a republic we have the mechanisms in place to make it one. We the people have to be willing to use them. The movement to elect Bernie Sanders for president is just the beginning. More Americans must insist that we elect politicians for office who aren't bought and paid for by corporate tax dollars. And in doing this we can still have a nice public debate about when and how much the government should be involved and when and how much it should leave things alone, but without wealthy donors dominating the outcome.",-1

The robin hood if you will, mentality of taking from the individuals who become successful due to their own hard work and talents and giving it to those who are not so successful. This is not a choice this is a forced mandate in a socialistic society. Why would you want to become successful and innovative if you will only end up with a similar outcome if you choose to skip college and work at a fast food joint? We as humans enjoy reaping what we sow, and we also enjoy having the power to donate and give to others. Taking that away is socialism and leads to mediocrity.",1
11,"For reference, I believe in egalitarian and universal laws. That means that the laws are applied to everyone and applied equally. Under socialism, some people have the law applied on them more, which is not egalitarian at all. Another thing is that the harder you work, the more you lose, because under socialism, you get the same amount no matter what, and any extra effort goes unrewarded. Contrast that with capitalism, where you stand to receive a bonus if you go above and beyond what is needed. In short, I'm under 35 and not a liberal. Therefore, I have no heart.",1
11,"I want to live in a country where if I have a better idea then someone else I can capitalize on that idea and earn more money. If everyone is going to be kept at roughly the same level and the wealthy are to be punished with increased taxes and financial burdens to help artificially equalize people, what incentive do I have to work hard? And if I do, am I really getting any benefit? I won't be paid substantially more, and because of that my quality of life will not increase. I have worked hard all my life and am not beginning to see huge benefits from years and years of sleeping only a few hours a week because I'm too busy working on project after project in the hope that I can give myself the life I have dreamed of. In a socialist system, this wouldn't benefit me in the slightest as any success I manage to gain will be countered by government policy to keep everyone equal. In America, I am doing very well for myself and despite being under 20 I am already well within the top 5% of American incomes. This is only possible in a Capitalist country and it makes me damn proud to be a Capitalist. I am immensely appreciative for the way our system works, and if anything it is too socialist in America as it is. All in all, what I want is opportunity. I want to be able to do something incredible and be compensated fairly for it, without the government robbing me blind to give what I've earned to someone who doesn't work anywhere as hard and frankly doesn't deserve to benefit freely from my blood, sweat and tears. I want to be able to come from anywhere in any situation and rise above it to become whatever I can dream. Only in a Capitalist system can you truly pursue your dreams without having a government just waiting to pounce on anyone who attempts to realize theirs.",1
11,"I don't support a system where I support others. I don't owe anyone anything, and I don't believe in working for the common good. One should earn what they want for themselves, and no one else.

But I don't believe it is mine or anyone else obligation to help them, and if I do it is a kindness undeserved.",1

Not only will socialism increase government power it will also increase the b-word, Bureaucracy. We already are a socialist country. We have been since the new deal with FDR.",1
11,"An interesting article about all the different taxes we have to pay. We are taxed far far more than under Prime Minister North's government (British PM at time of revolution). Heard that we pay equivalent overall tax rate of Denmark when the 97 taxes are calculated, but lack all the social niceties such as free university, free healthcare (not forced buy of insurance), free daycare, etc. A harmonized income tax (harmonized at city, state, and federal) or harmonized rent and mortgage tax (as before, percentage of rent/mortgage), and no other tax at any level of government, would be beneficial and transparent. I would support single-payer, whether that be the government pays, the corporation pays, or even a trade guild pays, for the basics: basic food, basic housing, utilities, education, and healthcare. If government is the payer, then the harmonized tax can be higher, if corporate or guild-payer, then the harmonized tax can be lower (constitutional amendment?). Fees would cover the latter two for funding. Disclaimer: this is not socialism, but a from of social democracy. Socialism, without any tags, would have no private ownership of means of production. While this may sound good, it actually would hold us back technologically as investors have no reason for investing.",1
11,"Income tax is the law, not voluntary. I am fine with providing the government with adequate funds to do its job of providing infrastructure and security so the citizens may go about the business of pursuing happiness. A market based system allows for competition, which lowers cost and filters out the bad seeds. Nationalizing things allows for stagnation, high cost and waiting lists. Socialism is too lacking in freedom for me.",1
11,"In principle, I think socialism loses to capitalism by producing less wealth overall. Marx wasn't really being cognizant of human nature with his ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need,"" deal. In practice, what happens is that many people get lax on the production and work side, since they're supposed to get what they need, anyway. And many of those who would be top producers also don't work as hard as they might, otherwise, as they don't get compensated for their efforts. A good example of this was the collective farms in Russia. Families were allowed small plots of their own, to raise crops, and the productivity their was quite a few times greater then on the collective farmland. People just aren't as motivated to work for ""the public good"" as they are for their own good. That said, there are many social programs in the United States that I'm glad of. A much bigger regret for me is that our politicians cannot keep their spending in check - what good is a system if it's not sustainable? Ours, with the huge overhang of debt and rapid further build-up of debt, certainly is not sustainable. In the real-world United States, I think that the desire for socialism works on a sliding scale, that the more one is for it, then the higher rate of taxation they are for, and the increased redistribution of wealth. I am not saying that capitalism is perfect, but socialism takes too much incentive away from people, and in the end we end up with a reduced pool of resources or wealth to spread around",1
11,"Yes, workfare is better than welfare. It is a fact that people feel better about themselves when they are working. Their no greater feeling in the world then providing for your family with hard earn money. Even though workfare isn't perfect it can set the foundation for a better life in and out of the home.",1
11,"Workfare is a relatively new, so we can expect their to be some pitfalls, I believe that workfare recipients should be represented by a union because they are being employed. By making workfare empathize on on education and career path it would be a lot better. I love the irony that it fulfills the socialist slogan ""From Each According To His Ability To Each According To His Needs""",1
11,I believe that a workfare system is better than a welfare system. I think that a system based on making sure people can work and put the responsibility to themselves instead of the government is always better than anything like a welfare system. The welfare system today has way too many problems.,1
11,"During my time in Tennessee when I was employed part time and also a full time college student who received benefits for myself and my son I was forced to complete a series of software teaching lessons for a workfare type program where I had to be enrolled in certain activities for a certain number of hours each week. This was a huge problem for me because my residence was 15 miles from where I had to do the studies and I couldn't take my child with me. I was already leaving him at daycare for work and studies, so this added even more on. Given the fact that the day care was 30 miles away, I used my small welfare payment of $120 each month to help cover the cost of gas to fulfill all of the requirements to receive the benefits. In the end, I was wasting a good portion of my time and being forced to spend the small amount of assistance I did receive in gas I wouldn't have used otherwise. In my experience workfare doesn't work.",-1
11,"the problem with workfare is that it does not guarantee a job to everyone. And even if it did, it does not guarantee that the job is going to pay enough to able people to have shelter and food. Welfare does guarantee this. It guarantees homes and food, as long as you're signed up.",-1

Communism, on its own, could be a great thing that every country needs. But when it's unjustly confused with both fascism and totalitarianism and corrupted by idiot dictators, the outcomes are never good. Think of Hitler, for example. He had a mindset that was border lining communism, but it was laced with anti-semitism and a horrible nationalistic view. Communism should be about the government supplying their people with money, health care and equality like they're supposed to. Not controlling their lives, killing third parties with opposing views and refusing to pay their own people because they're the government, and they can. Communism is delicate, corruptible, and needs a proper leader and a working government in order to fulfill its duty.

It occurs when those with investments and corporate interests run out of game space on the board reaching critical mass and devastating natural resources. When after examining the theory correctly we see that communism develops internal strength and drive away from it's present dependence on money toward a true martial art. I became a communist after watching my family destroyed by the American dollar. This pain helps me to see clearly. Moreover communism as I am redefining it is a religion of self respect and empowerment. A debased human has no character as defined philosophically in that we must aim higher and free ourselves from the mirage of prosperity. Communism facilitates art and motivates science on balance with its environment not the limiting whim of the elite. It works by adapting to change. This is easy for communism because eventually the world must facilitate wholeness. And this I would wager not only increases wellness or perceived state of health but erases fear because our work as the dollar fades is in our very hands.,-1

Imagine countries that are democratic. The power rests with the people? A very nonsensical philosophy!

11,"In a communist government, everyone is supposed to be equal. That means that everyone gets the same education, the same pay, and nobody can get ahead of anybody else. Incentives, such as higher pay for doctors, are necessary to give people the energy they need to work hard in a difficult job. If everybody gets the same education, their can be no advancements in technology and other subjects. This isn't the only reason why communism is bad. The government control absolutely everything. They can take your land at will. We saw a splendid example of this during the reign of Stalin. The government took farmers' land and used a terrible method of farming called,""collective farming."" The land was overworked and the soil eventually became infertile so no more crops could be grown. When the crops couldn't be grown, the government took more land. The rest of the land was used for factories in which the common people were forced to work in. If communism makes everybody equal, why didn't Stalin ever have to work in a factory like everybody else? Marx advocated ten rules in his Communist Manifesto for the forced redistribution of all land and property for the good of the national community. Citizens have no rights under communist rule. They are forced to join the new Communist government whether they like it or not. If they refuse to join the new communist government, it's off to the gulag. Lots of men with guns show up and take everything you have “for the glory of the motherland,” as the Soviets might have said. Communist rule may be directly blamed for the deaths of at least eighty-five million people in the twentieth century. Stalin alone murdered about twenty million, although other estimates range from fifty-three million to eighty million. It wasn't only Stalin's doing, though. Mao Zedong is believed to have murdered over forty- five million people by starvation. In Cambodia, the communist Khmer Rouge committed genocide on their own people. At least two million were executed by brutally primitive methods in keeping with the Khmer Rouge’s anti-technology stance. Some were even killed for wearing glasses. This is expressly why Marxist Communism has caused the utter collapse of so many national economies: it thinks in broad strokes, and fails to tell one subtlety from another. This, first and foremost, is because Communism is not grounded in reality.",-1

We sacrifice our health, our time, for the bucks. Communism will teach us that money isn't important and it shouldn't rule our lives, because that makes us become zombies who only accomplish things for ourselves, for our bank account.

11,"Communism takes places after a 'withering away' of the state during socialism. It is a genuinely stateless society. Socialism is when the proletariat use the mechanisms of the state to control production to their own democratic ends. Communism is when the people of that society have become socialised to the point that the system is embodied in them enough to no longer need the mechanisms of the state to preside over them. The positives of communism are that all production is planned democratically and geared toward providing for people's needs rather then just generating profit. The result is that the majority of people (the proletariat) are able to work less and get more (because they are not sacrificing so much of the fruit of their labour for the benefit of the bourgeoisie's profits). This was summed up by Karl Marx in the phrase: 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need' It would also mean that wasteful production is limited, thus making the system more environmentally sustainable. there would be an end to the boom and slump cycle, characteristic of capitalism as the economy would be democratically controlled and not at the behest of the mood swings of the market. Also communism eliminates the need for war because nations and their respective bourgeoisies will no longer need to compete for markets and national resources by fighting each other. Also measures such as the buildup of military expenditure in order to counteract the ailing world economy will cease. Finally, communism would end sexism and racism because these prejudices are ingrained in the capitalist discourse and reinforced as a way of dividing the exploited proletariat",-1

If this money was spread evenly it would avoid the social problems we currently experience. Communism can only work well if the people in power are fair and trustworthy.

For the general question above, Communism would be very beneficial and good for society. I would have to sadly say, I honestly don't see Communism ever working with the people we live with in this day. The debate where since communism did not work in Soviet Russia and other places is ultimately false if one is going by the Marxist idea of Communism (which is what I have been referring to). Indeed the Soviet Union and other failed ""Communist"" nations were more on the right of the political ideology scale, along with fascism. For Marxist Communism to be true, the dictators such as Stalin and and the current one in North Korea, Kim Jong Un , don't fit in the Communist category with their policies and actions. With the ""rulers"" not sticking to communism and the citizens that will most likely not cooperate with the system, it would be very difficult to have a Communist society in this day and age. For me, knowing all of this still doesn't change the fact that i approve of the ideology of Communism one bit.

11,"Only in libertarian socialist terms, which is what real communism was originally about This one is a difficult one to debate because really the term communism has no meaning anymore - it's been associated with the most authoritarian and libertarian of ideology... What I would support is libertarian socialism, but that is not necessarily synonymous with communism. I think if a society was dedicated to libertarian socialist ideals, perhaps as a result of some kind of peaceful takeover or, more likely, separation from a current capitalist country, it could certainly work. What we are talking about is a society run by direct democracy where the people control the corporations rather then the corporations being dictatorships. Spain has a history of socialist thought (socialists 1936) and the Zapatistas are another possible examples.

11,"Whatever i have read above regarding Communism is great except one thing that is everyone should get equal benefit,it's almost like a joking for example a servant cannot have same life as doctor should have.What is need to be addressed is make sure economical differentiation within the people of state/country doesn't get immense, there should be a balance so that even a servant can have affordable life.",-1
11,Communism is a great idea. Many don't like the idea because of fake communism. The USSR and China are both examples of Capitalism. True Communism would support Human rights better than Capitalism because it's basic ideas are to protect dignity and respect all human life. True Communism is when the government has left and the country is led by the people. The USSR was corrupted because the leaders did not want to leave power. However with true communism everyone would be equal and fair.,-1
11,"The only setback that communism face is is that it always comes under the control of a bad leader, or at least one that doesn't understand how to make it work properly. If there is every a competent leader leading a communist country, it would be fantastic because everyone one is equal.",-1
11,"Communism could only work on a global scale. If the whole world was classed as a single community and ran by a board of impartial and equal politicians. All people would contribute to a society that would provide them with resources that they need. Furthermore, people wouldn't be corrupted by greed and the less fortunate could have a fighting chance. Communism would only be successful by educating the next generation and teaching them the communist views from an early age. Therefore, they will be unbiased and won't be corrupted by the idea of money and greed.",-1
11,"Simply, it gives power to the productive people in society (worker control of production and distribution) and provides equality for all productive citizens. Even without this ideal from of communism-- as in the Soviet Union, China, etc.-- you have a centralized power that can make decisions with little resistance. This is both a curse and a blessing. It provides stability and the ability to change quickly but sometimes can be inhumane (even though the inhumane thing may actually be better for society in the long run). Some very stupid mistakes were made in past state capitalist economies which should not have happened. Such as stagnation and corruption: 1. their is absolutely no reason for stagnation. their is always work to be don't and their are always people to do this work. 2. Corruption is easily solved with a power balance between bureaus and accountability to the people (not necessarily democracy).",-1
11,"This one is a difficult one to debate because really the term communism has no meaning anymore - it's been associated with the most authoritarian and libertarian of ideology. What I would support is libertarian socialism, but that is not necessarily synonymous with communism. I think if a society was dedicated to libertarian socialist ideals, perhaps as a result of some kind of peaceful takeover or, more likely, separation from a current capitalist country, it could certainly work. What we are talking about is a society run by direct democracy where the people control the corporations rather then the corporations being dictatorships. Spain has a history of socialist thought (socialists 1936) and the Zapatistas are another possible examples. However, the closest societies in the world today to true libertarian socialism are probably the Nordic countries and the Netherlands, as well as perhaps Iceland. They have the strongest collective bargaining rights (IE. Rights for workers) and other programs that a true anarcho - socialist society would be likely to have.

Capitalism is bad in many other ways and neglects may of its people and their needs as well as manipulating them through advertisements and general life. All of this is true but Communism has a large major fault that makes it undesirable to many in a Capitalist system, For many Communism gives them no drive and nothing to work for, Very few seem to directly use this argument though.

Also it will make the middle class and the poor people happier that the rich are now poor. If communism spreads in the US, The rich will get what they deserve for being extremely selfish and greedy of their own money where they can give off to the poor instead, They use it for their own interests like organizing riots and controlling politicians.

11,"The 1917 October Revolution in Russia set the conditions for the rise to state power of Vladimir Lenin's Bolsheviks, Which was the first time any avowedly communist party reached that position. The revolution transferred power to the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, In which the Bolsheviks had a majority. The event generated a great deal of practical and theoretical debate within the Marxist movement. Marx predicted that socialism and communism would be built upon foundations laid by the most advanced capitalist development. However, Russia was one of the poorest countries in Europe with an enormous, Largely illiterate peasantry and a minority of industrial workers. Marx had explicitly stated that Russia might be able to skip the stage of bourgeois rule",-1
11,"Communism itself can be very appealing to some groups of people. The issue is that all Communist countries that have been in existence often are led by a dictator.

11,"there are many things that communism requires in order to be achieved. Oh and yeah, Communism isn't something you try like socialism (which is a horrible way to try to get to communism). Instead, Communism is the end result after society as a whole has decided to yearn for something other then conquering each other. In a communist society, You'd have the following: No need for money as your payment would be the work everyone does and vice-versa No need for centralized government if the education system is good enough R educate people to be able to participate in it. Everyone has a say and no one is more important than anyone else Low-skill jobs taken up by robots so we can work better, More attractive jobs and still have more leisure time Co-dependent cities that function as their own nations but still rely on each other in global exports and developments Lack of economic divisions since there's no money or unfair competition More leisure time and longer time in University No wars or crime (if we adopt Norwegian prison system)",-1

11,"It could work, The problem is human nature. Everyone treated equally would bring world peace. But we are greedy and someone always rises to power and is superior to everyone else (Stalin). The closest communism can get to work is in Trotskyism, Where the people still get their communism but can also vote in soviet councils. But communism really gives you no purpose in life as much as capitalism, Yet this would avoid racism and sexism in the government. Either ideologies can work but the reason communism is better is the memes.",-1

That is just what communism can achieve if you, yes - you people berating it like you've seen enough failures of it to convince you to hate the very idea of it.

11,Communism was manifested from the old idea of socialism in which there would be no government or ruler each man would work of each man. A long as socialism has this principals Communism will always manifest to a governed area. Communism's old ways are always corrupted by humans as well as it should never be ruled by one person. That one person will always end in greed. The principles of Communism will always work because they are almost flawless. The fact is we should change the governing style keeping either a communist theme or communist policies. The USSR failed due to the era of stagnation lead by Brezhnev. The fall behind good quality consumer goods in the soviet union against the west was a key factor to its collapse in 1991. The successor of Brezhnev which was Andropov had the idea of how to pull the soviet union out of the deep whole of economic stagnation. His Cracking down on political protest and anti soviets was an idea of genius. He pulled the Soviet union into reforms that I needed. Unfortunately Brezhnev needed a tough successor to fix his mistakes. Andropov was the man to do so because he was experienced and had clung onto power for a very long time.,-1

11,"The Communist League, an international association of workers, which could of course be only a secret one, under conditions obtaining at the time, commissioned us, the undersigned, at the Congress held in London in November 1847, to write for publication a detailed theoretical and practical programme for the Party. Such was the origin of the following Manifesto, the manuscript of which travelled to London to be printed a few weeks before the February [French] Revolution [in 1848]. First published in German, it has been republished in that language in at least twelve different editions in Germany, England, and America. It was published in English for the first time in 1850 in the Red Republican, London, translated by Miss Helen Macfarlane, and in 1871 in at least three different translations in America. The French version first appeared in Paris shortly before the June insurrection of 1848, and recently in Le Socialiste of New York. A new translation is in the course of preparation. A Polish version appeared in London shortly after it was first published in Germany. A Russian translation was published in Geneva in the sixties 1 . Into Danish, too, it was translated shortly after it's appearance. However much that state of things may have altered during the last twenty-five years, the general Men’s Association, 1871, where this point is further developed.) Further, it is self-evident that the criticism of socialist literature is deficient in relation to the present time, because it comes down only to 1847; also that the remarks on the relation of the Communists to the various opposition parties (Section IV), although, in principle still correct, yet in practice are antiquated, because the political situation has been entirely changed, and the progress of history has swept from off the earth the greater portion of the political parties their enumerated. But then, the Manifesto has become a historical document which we have no longer any right to alter.

11,"If your mom came home and found you smoking your dog, she would be mad. To make her unmad you need to eat some goldfish. This can be all blamed on democracy. If this were a communist country your mother couldn't get mad at your, shed have to get mad at everyone in the whole country. This is why communism is good, because it protects your from your evil dogs.",-1
11,The argument in question is if communism can work and i believe it can work in the uk due to the country growing larger due to immigration etc.So with more people in the UK means cash will be hard to get due to lack of jobs so if we used communism we can spread cash round allowing poverty to not exist in the Uk(England mainly),-1
11,"A lot has changed in three hundred years. People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of ‘things’. We have eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. The economics of the future is somewhat different. You see, money doesn't exist in the 24th century… The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity. - Captain Picard Basically everything in Star Trek becomes true, and the world in Star Trek is communist, so it is bound to happen.

11,I think communism is good cause everything would be equal. No one will be rich or poor. there would be no need for people to get jealous of each other. Everyone would have the latest technology and everything would be great. No one would starve and everyone would be treated the same.,-1
11,"The system of communism means that everyone gets equal amounts of cheese, this is good for society because in Capitalism the richest in society get more cheese then the poorest in society, this is very unfair and prevents the poorest from moving up in society as the rich spend their cheese on making sure they can get more cheese, but the poor have no cheese to spend on getting themselves more cheese.",-1
11,"Communism at its core is about being the poor to the status of a middle class person. All work in a communism is for the better of the people as a whole. Job and their pay is not determined by education alone but by skills and needs, letting those with more needs make the money they need. Now not all communist countries have the people’s best interest in mind, but is the best for considering the people.",-1
11,"In the United States, the income gap is becoming wider and wider as the years pass by. The top 1% own more than 35% of the wealth in America in 2007, which is outrageous. If America composed of 100 people, it would take 35 people from the lower class to make up the same wealth as 1 person from the top of the upper class. This money can be better spent on the poor, so they can rise up and get the things they need to survive, instead of living in dirty, cramped, disgusting low-end motels while barely being able to afford food, healthcare, and essentials to life, and even worse, they could be living in the streets where they might eventually die from starvation and disease. People might say that the people have the opportunity to become rich, but it that actually true? Does everyone in America have the same chance to become rich and prosperous? If it actually worked, there would be a lot more people that made more than 30000 dollars a year, which includes 50% of the US population. This type of inequality creates crime and violence, as The Atlantic once stated in one of their articles “there’s a good amount of research from all over the world that suggests that places with pronounced income inequality are more likely to have high rates of violent crime, a finding that makes intuitive sense: the wider the socioeconomic gap, per Becker's 1968 model, the more gains potential criminals perceive.”",-1
11,"Capitalism causes people to steal from each other since there is uneven wealth and sometimes attack each other. Communism on the other hand, gives what you need based on your contribution to society and it puts all the citizens in the Working Class instead of the middle classes that capitalism uses, so Communism does not give much of a point to cause Robbery or Homicide.",-1
11,I heart communism I would do anything for it to come back please Karl Marx we need someone like you just so we can make Russia back to what it was we need this. It is for the better just help us get communism back please I beg of you.,-1
11,"Although communism might have gone wrong in some countries, the idea is good. It will lessen many problems in the world today. Most people in this world are driven by money. And simply look how many problems that has caused. If Communism is don't right, then the world will be a better place. Humanity will no longer be driven by greed for wealth. Poverty and hunger will be solved. Animals will stop being killed. Everybody is equal, and always will be equal. Humanity's made up system of money and wealth has taught us otherwise. It has caused pollution, death, and suffering. It has made others suffer for the pleasure of the fortunate. This system of money is not simply a system of hard work, as many believe it, it is a system of chance. Those in poverty and suffering suffer from bad luck, not laziness. Communism can be a democracy, like voting for a candidate. If it is supported by society and controlled, it will go well. Communism doesn't simply mean the government can do whatever they want, it just means everybody gets a fair share. It means the world will not be run by businesses and wealthy people who care about money more than the welfare of others. People will spend their lives for a good cause. Instead of using their lives for a piece of paper or metal, they will do it for pride,goodness, and caring. They will spend their lives helping others, instead of ignoring for the sake of money. Money has tore apart families, broken friendships, sparked betrayal, unleashed suffering. They will cure others for the sake of doing something good and not seeing them die. They will educate others for the sake of respect and seeing them being successful. In our society of money, their are very few people who do something for the sake of doing it, and not for the pieces of paper of metal which we give fake value. Some people against Communism say that our society will be messed up with Communism. But that is not true. Our society is messed up now. Look at global warming, where does that come from, factories and companies creating pollution to gain wealth and money. Where do all these conflicts and problems come from-poverty. Where does hunger come from- again poverty. Why aren't people trying to help solve these problems- because they don't or can't have or make enough money to or by solving these problems. With Communism people will do good to do good. They will work for the right cause. Not for simply greed and pieces of paper and metal.",-1
11,"Stalin sucks but communism doesn't. Communism doesn't suck because poetry says it does, therefore it doesn't. Poetry also plays a musical instrument, so is a capitalist pig.

11,"Communism will prevail because many provided examples have shown that it's beneficial. Having equality throughout will help the economy and being able to support the people for the people.

She had long blonde hair and eyes more blue then the sea and I saw her from across the room. I went to her and gave her an offer she could not refuse. ""hey BB wanna me to eat you out, Then fuck you."" Her eyes fluttered and she smelled like an angel. She responded with ""sure what the hell"" So we went to the bathroom and we loved all 10 secs of it before I ""finished"" She sighed but said good time. It was the best time of my life. I later learned I got an STD and I didn't have any health care. I need communism please put my boi brook back into office he's the communist we need",-1

It wasn't true communism and bread lines weren't that good but I remember putting the last bolt on that nuclear weapon and I knew that if the world fell, I would be part of the reason why. And after every each year, I moved to Canada. Canada is good too. I want good Marx communism",-1
11,In theory communism sounds like a great idea. In practice it has failed for different reasons. First a successful communist country must be democratic with local councils or soviets these councils must have a large amount of power compared to central government this way political power is closer to the people this is where nearly every communist country went wrong. If any goes wrong people are held accountable. From an economic standpoint the communist nations have been undeveloped and those countries had to prioritise what industries they had to protect themselves from hostile countries such as Germany under fascism or later the Americans in the Soviet Union they produced very few cars but a lot of military vehicles the soviets inability to produce the volume of automobiles which are vital to a modern economy a developed country such as the us germany would be ideal staging posts as they have a heavy industrial focus which can give people a western standard of living in a communist economic system also a big difference that will shake communism as well as capitalism is the invasion of automation all of my recommendations and the advent of automation means that this revised communism will not be the same as USSR,-1
11,"In today's world there is a lot of corruption in democracy. Rich get richer and poor get poorer. We all should be born on this earth with equal chances of surviving. For example in democracy, if a cobbler needs money he suffers while it is easier for a doctor to get the money. All occupations should be considered equal because all are equally hard. This will also put an end to black money with the people, poverty, inequality, class distinction and will close the gap between the rich and the poor. A good government and cooperative citizens can make this a successful form of government.",-1
11,"The reason I make this claim is simple. Communism allows for the equality of all. Some may make the argument that this provides for no growth or ability to get somewhere in life, and to those i would say ""hop off my tip"". Y'all are just jealous. Get wrecked mate!!!",-1
11,With capitalism you don't get the money the owners only get the money which is totally not fair for the poor or working class especially when the whole world is almost in a financial crisis so i rather take down those capitalists pigs and up with the glory communism all glory to communism supporters.,-1
11,"It allows everybody to have an equal opportunity and an equal shot at achieving their goals, so the system is not actually flawed, true communism cannot function on one person being the leader, ie a president, true communism would need a committee of members to make the difference, each individual should be background checked and the members should swap out from time to time to stop anyone from getting too powerful",-1
11,"WE have Vietnam veterans on our streets, they served our country and because of illness and we stand here not being able to help. Communism helps those in need and if we eliminate the inequality of finance, then the country will prosper. If people tell you about how communism failed in the past, that is not communism, that was a form of socialism, because in communism, there is no such thing as one leader. That defeats the whole point of everyone being equal. Communism will rise!",-1
11,One of the most common augments agents communism is that it killed millions of people Rhodes inflated stats are from the black book of communism who's own author called his book bullshit a better number would be 10-15 million which is nonexistent compared to the death toll of capitalism which kills 20 million people each year due to the lack of food water and medical equipment,-1
11,Sharing is caring and caring is Sharing the teacher sayed and so communism is described by the teacher in a sentence it can be don't well as China provides good evidence that all u need is good leadership and hard working men like the poles in other words it better than capitalism as no one would make fun of u for being poor as no one is poor nor rich,-1
11,"The reason it is good is because medicinal breakthroughs and other advancements would be available for everybody and their probably would not be social status like rich and poor, there would be respectable and non respectable , i live in the USA and i think that combined with the right leaders communism would be good",-1
11,"The problem with communism now is that people question the government. They don't listen, they either have to underachieve or over achieve, if everyone worked the same and didn't ask questions things would go great. Also with a communist government there should be a dictator, because one leader can have all the power and be able to tell everyone what to do by what they think is right.",-1
11,"HOLY SHITE!!!! So all this time COMMUNISM IS A GOOD THING!!!? THIS IS WHAT I DISCOVERED: The ideology of communism -People need one another -When people work together as equals, they achieve greater things -No-one should have more than anyone else - everybody's needs are equally important -Governments should make sure that everyone's needs are being met -their is central control of the economy WHAT THE HELL!!!! COMMUNISM ALL THE WAY",-1

11,"Communism is amazing because it's the opposite of Donald Trump scum. He is a racist bigot. However, communism treats everyone equally and that's why it's amazing. No one needs wealth. If you think you need wealth you're a greedy pig. You'll get enough to eat in communism and that is good enough.",-1
11,"Equality is all the world needs. Without it, some are left to starve and or slave away to earn money, while others live it up, not a care in the world. This injustice is significant, and anyone who says otherwise is fooling themselves, and obviously takes their life for granted. Think of the lyrics from Bittersweet Symphony; “Try to make ends meet, you're slave to money, then you die”. Not with communism. Communism was founded upon the very fact that we are all human, regardless of gender, race, sexuality, social standing. If we, as the human race, want to progress forward in society, then we need to accept this fact. Certainly, communism has failed, but without failure, some of the best inventions would never have come to be. Yes, communism can be set up in a way, in which, for example, a cleaner gets paid as much as a doctor. But If we, as humans, collectively work together, to fix the issues of communism, then only greatness can happen. Think of what rights YOU deserve and that YOU are missing out on EVERY DAY. Thank you.",-1

North Korea is only bad because kim dildo guy makes it bad. But china good. America needs communism or we will lose to china. China's already getting stronger then America and america can not let this stand. TAKE FROM THE RICH GIVE TO THE POOR",-1
11,"True communism by Marx has never actually been put into effect. Stalin controlled the Soviet Union as a dictator, but not as a actual communist leader. Communism is a very broad term for things like trotskyism, Stalinism, Maoism, and Marxism. They are more based on Politics then creating a utopian society. I'd say the Idea of communism is good, but it's execution is poorly made by power hungry dictators. Mainly communism is better than monarchies, which was why the Russians rebelled. Mao in China should have not rebelled, as A Capitalist China would have worked out a lot better than a communist china, however If Just the Soviet Union were to incorporate a good version of communism, It could work out. Mainly a cooperation of Capitalism and communism into a hybrid society would be a good society.",-1
11,"Um In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, ""common, universal"") is the philosophical, social, political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money[3][4] and the state.[5][6] Communism includes a variety of schools of thought, which broadly include Marxism, anarchism (anarchist communism) and the political ideologies grouped around both. All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system, capitalism; that in this system there are two major social classes: the working class—who must work to survive and who make up the majority within society—and the capitalist class—a minority who derives profit from employing the working class, through private ownership of the means of production—and that conflict between these two classes will trigger a revolution. The revolution will in turn establish social ownership of the means of production, which according to this analysis is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism. Criticism of communism can be roughly divided into those concerning themselves with the practical aspects of 20th century communist states and those concerning themselves with communist principles and theory.[8]",-1
11,Communism stops poverty and a few other simple struggles but the people on the right say that people are already. People are already corrupt due to having been stuck with capitalism their whole lives. They've had to see the struggles of getting jobs and homelessness. Communism would be good for the community if we give it an actual trial,-1
11,"First of all, the government should not be involved in the free trade of society at all, AKA. Laissez-faire. A government should never have enough power to control the means of production, supply and demand. Honestly, socialism (while I still prefer capitalism) is a much better idea. Communism requires elitism, because you can't enforce a classless society if no one is enforcing it. Instead of the government being headed by Bourgeois who believe they are elite because they have decided to take a leadership position, the community (or society) elects to be classless and have everything equal, while still keeping a democratic system to elect leaders of the community.",-1
11,"Everyone will be equal. No one would be poor, and no one will be rich. This would would eliminate the socio-economic differences that plague our society today. True communism has never been reached since people want innovation.In a communist society no one would need innovation since their life would only sustain the government, not improve it.Plus, a sustaining communist society would provide anything anyone would ever need.",-1
11,"To attempt to enforce equal outcome, you must inherently take away equal opportunity. Some people are at a disposition to do better than others. So some people must have some opportunity taken away, and that never ends in a peace outcome. Someone must enforce this, and it is always the government. When the government starts to take control over people's rights, a totalitarian state is formed. When that happens as we all know, the will of the people is suppressed and dictated by their leaders. This can very easily lead to people revolting against their government which leads to people having been imprisoned and killed.",-1
11,"Communism, in its purest form, is everybody getting the same. When everybody gets the same necessities such as housing, food, water and electricity (maybe even wifi!) it means homelessness will not exist. In this capitalist world 3.5 million people go homeless, with around 1.35 million of them CHILDREN!! Now you may argue that communism has killed many people, 100 mil in 100 yrs, but many of these deaths were from indirect causes and not from direct genocide of people. If this does not sway you thought on communism deaths, then let's look at the 250,000,000 deaths caused by capitalism (this figure even excludes the two world wars!!) this is over double what people have been told about communist deaths! Also, I've just read that a person has said that using some money on the Olympics is ""corruption"" (this statement was also based on figures found AFTER communism, so that point is invalid), corruption is the ""dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery."", these things are commonly seen in capitalist countries and communities with, for example, Bush being dishonest on the true cause of the Afghan war and the bribery used on the police systems of capitalist countries is despicable! Most capitalist police systems also are racist, with multiple black deaths in America from white policemen.",-1
11,"With Communism sure many times over the years it has been misused and then people call it ""A Road to Dictatorship"" but the ideology is made that everyone would have in the same amount of almost everything and with every job people would have to work to get around. Also with all the money the government make their would be enough money and that think of it how many billionaires even TRILLION-air their would definitely be enough money to go around to everyone .",-1
11,"Communism is a from of government that ensures the entire community benefits and not just those fortunate few. Communism ensures that everyone gets housing, money, education, electricity etc. The government would be fair and just, promoting empathy and social justice. For some reason people get totalitarianism and communism confused. You can be a democratic communist country where everyone gets an equal chance and you still have freedom of expression.",-1
11,If all countries adopt communism beliefs their will be no poverty no homeless people and everyone gets paid the same treated the same and everyone would be happy example say you take some lowlife who did nothing for society and all of a sudden won the lottery and became a multi millionaire that wouldn't be very fair as if someone who works 8 hours a day 5 days a week and just trying to survive by a thread you can see that there's a lot of disproportion here therefore if we make everyone get paid the same wages and get rid of the lottery nobody should be complaining after that. But ignorant Americans can't see the point and the good in communism all they can see are the numbers of paychecks going down and down and they're bills going up and up while they stuff their face with doughnuts.,-1
11,"Everyone will be equal. No war, no poverty, no starvation, everyone has equal pay, no class divide. It would be perfect. War is based on profit, and the lower classes have to suffer when war is happening, while the upper classes sit back and watch these lower class people tear each other limb from limb. Communism is the way forward",-1

11,People take a stereotype of communism and assume that the stereotype is all that it is. I was talking to someone about communism and they immediately told me it was bad when he didn't even understand it we need to break down the stereotype that communism is bad and show them the good side,-1
11,Communism gives everyone an equal opportunity to live without poverty. In capitalist countries it is survival of the fittest and the lower social classes are ignored. But in communism we can all live equally. Other countries that have tried communism haven't turned out well because they didn't know what they were doing.,-1
11,"When people think of communism, they think of Russia and Russia's communism failed. For example, We colonize the moon and create the united states of moon.

In this hypothetical reason, communism would be great.",-1

11,"In a Marxist/communist society, the people work at their expense and the only real reason the government is their is to put the people's words on paper and make it official.

Also, no man, woman, or child would be above or below the next. All would be equal.",-1
11,"Most people that say no don't seem to know that Russia is the most capitalist country in the entire world. I personally prefer liberalism or socialism but I'd just like to get this out of the way. Capitalism isn't the answer, it's a good starting society but not ideal. Communism too is very dangerous since it depends so heavily upon that those in charge, those with almost literally all the power, tend to easily become corrupted or mad with power (like Stalin).",-1
11,"Communism is designed to create an equal balance between everyone in a society, correct? Communism would help a country that has no innovation, no bright ideas to boost it forward in the global rankings. At the time of China's institution of communism, it was a country that would have benefited from the economic model. However, a country like America, which was created on the promise of innovation, or dreams and things of that sort would not bode well with communism. America was a world power for the reason that our constituents wanted to work hard and create things that helped them and their society. China was at one point not like that, but they have made significant strides. One could just as well argue that the current economic stature of America could benefit from communism, but that is a separate argument.",-1

11,"Communism embraces equality. With everyone getting paid equally the citizens don't have to worry about homelessness. Everyone would live a fair life were people can embrace their talents while enjoying life. Communism makes health care easy to pay for, along with education, and other important things that are needed in people's lives. Monopolies won't get created. The government owns and controls he business so there is no competition. This means people can only produce a limited number of goods and are unable to demand higher prices for their committees. This means prices are stable, The supply and demand don't go crazy and unemployment decreases.",-1

11,"We all know about capitalism. Those dogs let companies walk all over the working class. Well no more! Communism is the greatest system of economics ever created, because of Lenin’s mustache, the fact that overthrowing the bourgeoisie is fun, and waiting in breadlines is fashionable. First of all, look at a picture of Lenin. His mustache is the greatest in all history, and he supported communism, therefore so should you. Secondly, overthrowing the bourgeoisie is fun. Who doesn't love storming their mansions and palaces, and tearing their furniture apart, melting down their silverware for the metal and jewels inside? It is just pure, childlike fun, and we should do it more often. For my final reason, I will use fashion. The latest style is to spend hours waiting in line for a single loaf of bread. Who doesn't love getting free bread?",-1
11,"Communism benefits society by increasing people's happiness and their interest and motivation in their work as there is no concept of money, which means that people can do jobs that they want to do and jobs that can benefit society, not be forced into jobs that pay well, but deliver no satisfaction. To support this consider how most people don't work for money but for happiness, as in jails, work is withheld as a punishment. Moreover, communism would help society by eliminating inequality and poverty.",-1

Capitalism is based on the government taking money like communism but communism gives the money to the community meanwhile Capitalism takes all the money for the government and keeps it. In my opinion, communism is perfect! -Abdullah Hasan",-1
11,"Communism is a good idea as it allows all citizens to be equal, it stops corruption because all the citizens all have the same job, amount of money and power. With no one fighting in the country because of status or power, the country would be at peace, everything would run freely and rules would be followed. Also because everyone is expected to work their share, there would be no poverty in the country, everyone would have the amount of money, work, food and shelter they need, no one would be left on the streets because they have to work, they have to do their share of work. This ideology is also a good idea because since everyone is expected to work their share, the government's economy would no fail, constant work for the people meant that the government got more money for the country's safety (army), health (food, hospitals) and resources (building schools, jobs).

11,"Currently in AP world history were having a communism vs capitalism debate. After doing research I have found that the idea and basis of communism is more efficient then every other from of government. If a perfect communism utopian society was created then it would flourish and rise to the top. The problem is, there's never actually been a completely correct communist society, they've all been corrupt because they've used this beautiful idea to their advantage.",-1
11,"Really communism is the same as any other from of government, as long as the right people are in power it's good but when you have bad people ruling the country cough STALIN cough it doesn't turn out so well. Communism gets rid of social class, so now you won't have to pretend you left your wallet at home every time you see that homeless beggar on the side of the street. That's right I know you do that. Rather than using money as an incentive the lazy slackers can be punished otherwise. You could make them work longer hours. Nobody wants to work longer hours so boom! Incentive to work. If you work somewhere where you build things, you can keep them if you're a hard worker. If not you have to give them up. Everyone gets an education, so we wouldn't have the stupidity epidemic occurring right now in the good ol' USA. Everyone gets a home, so we won't have the problem that for every one homeless person in America there are five open homes. Everyone gets healthcare, so we won't die because we can't afford the surgeries we might need. And capitalists love to say how communism kills so many people, but capitalism is much, MUCH worse behind the scenes. Capitalists just turn a blind eye to the poor left dying on the streets by their economic system, but they're all too quick to bring up the failure of the ""communist"" Soviet Union and the purges and whatnot.",-1
11,"Sure, past communists have really messed up their countries and other people (looking at you Stalin), but the sheer idea of Communism in the US is GREAT because it provides equal opportunity for all, gives everyone the same rights, and in a (semi) prosperous country such as the US, it will work very well because of the fact that the standard of living for EVERYONE will be the same. Sure, that might mean certain rich people will live in 2-story flats, but that means equality! Communism is perfect for social rights, the poor, and the government. And of course, we can't forget the corruption that goes on today in our own government. A Communist society prevents corruption because there are no outside influencers!",-1

11,"I would not consider myself someone who knows a lot about communism and capitalism, but I am aware of the fact that capitalism exploits workers. I know this debate is not about capitalism, and I don't want to shift the focus to it, but I do believe that communism is good for the working class. With little to no exploitation it allows for a higher quality of living for the working class. Communism has pros and cons, I myself am socialist and would not go as far as to say that communism is the answer, but I do believe that communism has a positive effect on society. Communism doesn't have a good effect on poor countries, but neither does any system. Up in Canada, if we suddenly became communist, it wouldn't have very many negative effects. Since Canada has a pretty good economy (not lately, but in general) if we redistributed the profits equally, obviously it would negatively impact the richest 1%, but it wouldn't have a large effect on the rest of the population, not good nor bad. In a country with a good economy, the political system doesn't have a huge effect on the well being of the economy. If we look at society, I think it has a positive effect. A lot of countries that are poor and have low quality of living that are communist, is not a result of communism, those countries would be poor either way, and with a capitalist system, it would result in an even lower quality of living for 90% of the population.",-1

You know I've never seen somebody out in green trees, plenty of money and nobody disliking them and that person still frowning sharply, wonder why?

11,"No matter how hard we try, their will be no perfect government. But at least Communism will be the next best thing. It encourages work, which will eliminate most of the problems we have today. In fact, money, which is supposedly the root of all evil, mainly exists to get people to do work for people who don't want to do work. Communism will eliminate the use of money, and get people to do their own work. This will lead to the reduction of obesity, loss of sleep, stress, and other issues. And this is only a small portion of what good Communism would do. Keep in mind that only the lazy, greedy, and just plain bad people, would not like this way of life.",-1

With the communist government, their will be no more worry about jobs. They've got you covered. :D A guaranteed lifetime job for everyone because the government wants everyone to be able to make money. The communist government cares. Everybody should have a right to earn money of their own and be able to work happily to support this great economy. With the guaranteed lifetime jobs and a constant pay, everybody can live equally and happily in this great country. A singular basic pay rate so that there is no wealth gap and everyone is given the same income, because rich people sometimes oppress poor people. No difference in societal wealth since everyone is paid the same No corporations to oppress people with bad work conditions. Everybody is pretty much treated equal by the government and given equal health care. The government likes all men to be treated equally. In a capitalistic economy, their are rich people and poor people. Who wants to be poor? This is why the communist governments want the best for all of their people and therefore give them equal jobs, living conditions and health care. Poor people in a capitalistic economy may not even be able to afford living spaces or healthcare! Who wants that to happen to them? Creating everyone equal is a major benefit of this type of government. there isn't any racism since the government can control mean opinions. there are no income taxes so people get to safe and keep more of their money. No rich people can lie in their mansions and not work since they are forced to work. Why Communism is good for a country. The ideology of communism is not bad, it just has a bad reputation due to the aggression that the communist leaders had. In reality communism is a good way to keep everyone happy. In capitalist countries their are always complaints about unemployment and taxes being too high or something of the sort but, communism doesn't have those and everyone is equal under the government. there aren't many revolutions since everyone loves the leaders of communist countries.

11,"In, Animal Farm, a bunch of animals lead a rebellion against the humans and create a new order in which all animals are equal. Afterwards, the pigs go and paint “The Seven Commandments” as they called it. These were 1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. 2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. 3. No animal shall wear clothes. 4. No animal shall sleep in a bed. 5. No animal shall drink alcohol. 6. No animal shall kill any other animal. 7. All animals are equal. This book showed what communism is. Communism is a flawed system that is oppressive, demotivating, and proven to fail. Before I continue on with how communism doesn't work, I'll explain what communism is. Communism is a system in which the government, not the people, take control of trade and production of goods. They state that the goods will be distributed equally. Everybody has the same amount of wealth since the government manages all the wealth. The government also controls religion and education. This means that there is a classless society in which everybody is equal. It is essentially a utopia. This how the communist say it is. In reality, Communist governments are oppressive. For example, Communist governments take away our rights that we hold so dearly in the US. If a person in the US doesn't like a policy the government made, that person is allowed to disagree. But in a communist regime, that same person would be arrested or killed by the government. According to the book, World History our human History, communist North Korea, killed or imprisoned anybody that spoke against it. These communist regimes must be put to an end. Communist governments are also demotivating. In, World History our human History, it talks about Mao’s Great Leap Forward. In his so called great leap forward, he moved thousands upon thousands of farmers off of their private property since he declared it illegal. This create a lack of ownership. He moved these farmers to farming communes. The book also states “With the government demanding ever-larger harvests, commune officials drove the workers mercilessly. The government shipped more and more food abroad. Soon there wasn't enough food for the farmers themselves.” Later is states that 20,000,000 people died due to starvation (World History our human History). These people were forced to work in the fields for hours and hours and got nothing in return. Why should people work if they don't profit from their drudgery? In Animal Farm, there was a mystery as to what happened to the cows’ milk. The animals thought that it should be shared equally. But it disappeared somehow. It was later revealed that the pigs were drinking it. The pigs said that it was necessary for them to drink or else Jones would come back (Animal Farm). See part 2 for more.",1

In my opinion, This would cause more gang violence and normal people could be living their lives in fear because half of the population hate them. It just wouldn't work. You could say that voting for who gets into power would be more fair, But that would be unfair on the people whose votes got out-don't, Leading to more protests.

11,"Our country, America, was founded by men of God. These men established a Constitution that included principles of being equal. Communism twists the word equal to the word trapped. Is equality to be forced into something? God created this world we live in so that we may have agency. Satan, the devil, on the other hand, desires no such thing. Satan is of force, persuasion, and temptation. Communism without a doubt is of the devil, because the power man holds of it is of force. While one may be blinded by it's attractiveness, once a part of it, you are trapped. One who roots for Communism roots for the devil. Karl Marx sacrificed his soul to the devil so that he could have power on this earth. However, early Latter-day prophet, Joseph Smith, sacrificed his soul on this earth, so that it could live forever in the life to come. He supported God, and the powerful tool called agency. Communism destroys all agency, and while all may be equal, their souls are trapped, and they have no rights.",1

Communist leaders Joe Stalin and Mao Zedong were the most brutal dictators in all of history. One last point I want to make is that communism leads to a horrible economy. Think about it, you and your neighbor get the same amount of money, but your neighbor doesn't work, why should you work? To put it simply if your entitled to everything, why care about anything?",1
11,"In communist Czechoslovakia, the government checked everything that entered the country. When we would send toilet paper, considered a luxury, it would not get to our family because someone would take it. Honestly, I can not see communism ever working because people will take whatever they want because of it.",1
11,"Communism has never successfully been employed anywhere in the world. China, USSR, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, etc. and it has caused nearly 110 million deaths. If something keeps failing over and over it's time to try something else. Because the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result.",1
11,"Communism, even according to Marx himself in the Manifesto, requires humans to be perfect. When answered, he said, “science would solve it.” Ever since, science still has not overwritten a person’s mind in order to create the perfect human. Not only is it physically impossible, but it’s just never worked. Even in the Lenin years, he starved millions of people (see Ukrainian ‘famine’ of 1921-1922.) Communism was only created because Karl Marx didn't want to get a job. That’s not a joke.",1
11,"Yes, money is evenly distributed between the lower classes and the rich and that everyone is equal, but having everything being controlled by the government of a country is ineffective.Economically, it is bad because when a government controls business it doesn't have the proper motivation to improve a company because, unlike entrepreneurs, who have to think wisely about the decisions that they are going to make. Government officials don't have that kind of motivation to innovate or improve things for customers, because it simply doesn't need to for profit. A government uses the taxpayers money and doesn't need to rely upon the regular customers and therefore discouraging innovation. This creates inefficient economies and that's why countries who are communist like China have adapted and turned 97% of companies in the country privately owned. Now you see why China is the 2nd largest economy on Earth and is communist, because communism doesn't improve people's lives because of stagnating economic growth.Therefore I believe that capitalism is better, but that still has it's disadvantages to.",1
11,"If you work for 5 hours you will get the same amount of bread or money as the person who has worked for 3. Leading to less volubility of money and less production and jobs get don't, therefore it is bad for society. It also goes against all human instincts. No more freedom of speech. Do what your told. BAD FOR SOCIETY.",1
11,"While I agree that communism could work in a smaller situation such as a single family, it doesn't work with countries. This entire argument can be closed by asking the question, ""What communist country in the past hasn't been a complete fuckup?"" The problem is that there are none. The USSR starved 20 million, and the communist Chinese killed 60 million, in a span of under 10 years. Some may argue that this is because of corruption, and I am inclined to agree. However, the problem with communism, and dictatorship in general, is that it promotes corruption. there are no checks or balances like their are here in the US, where the power of the Executive branch can be overridden by that of the Judicial, or the Legislative branch. A dictator can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. In communism or in a dictatorship, there is no way to dodge corruption. Even in capitalism, there is no way to dodge corruption. But the three branches of the United States government minimize the damage.",1
11,"Communism is actually great and I clicked the no button to spark some controversy. But the same doesn't go for the rest of you plebs, because if you think communism is bad and click the yes button the hitmen of lord putin will kill you for being a traitor and a liar. I have special authority to be here on this side, behind enemy lines... Please forgive me my comrades",1
11,It has never been successful ever and it makes the government corrupt and it is a complete waste of a social system and activism. All communist countries are third or second world countries which means they are not successful so shut up you libtards and go back to your safe space.,1
11,"If you think logically then communism would be the best for a society but as proven many times before it never works examples soviet russia,north korea because in that horobble place people are being treated so bad killed if your christian then you die very fast they hate all christians. But basically communism is everyone shares everything and their is one main person that separates everything but if it did work like that it would be great but it never does what usually happens is the dictator takes all the supplies or a big peace and becomes crazy with power and the government collapses and this is want a revolution or a big war turns out some examples are like hitler because he went crazy with power he first plotted to over through the government but that didn't work because when he tried he nearly died for the second time the first was in a trench when he got gassed and then all he could think of is to get germany back on it's feat but let's get back on the topic of how power changed a person ok so after he spent five years in jail he ended up getting back to where he started and the government gave him a part to calm him down but that just persuaded him and he went on to take full control of the government after that he disguised whole factories like schools and started making his armata of planes he was taking what was happening in italy and trying to do it himself and soon he ended up taking control over france and lost the battle to great britain he bombed them but churchill sent lots of light planes and ended up giving hitler his big defeat then hitler parre up with stalin and ended up back stabbing him and attacking stalingrad which was stalin's well most prized thing so stalin's eggo didn't let him back down and he forced stalen in defeat and after that he ended up getting brought down by three forces but first let's talk about this churchill rozavel and stalin join forces and took hitler down by force he also distracted hitler by using a decoy army made of props led by patton wich was called D-day on june 6 after that the good forces came up to berlin and hitler commited suicide also i would like to point out that hitler took all of his inspiration from mussolini, when he died he had his body",1
11,"If you know that the guy working next to you in the production line will be getting paid the same amount as you then their is no reason to work hard at all. You have no freedom with your money or property and it is not just corrupt people in higher powers that ruin it, it is simply the fact that human nature goes against communism. Communism also only favors the labor worker while doctors, farmers, and lawyers are thrown to the wayside, Communism might equalize everyone, but it will simply equalize everyone into being poor.",1
11,"As you know, communism is a more democratic than republican idea. Although I am a republican, I still respect some democrats. Anyways, do you really believe those who lounge around all day and do absolutely no work deserve to get paid. Think again. Maybe it's time to change your mind before you get yourself killed.",1
11,"Look at literally every communist country back in the day! Vietnam went into an economic crisis, cuba could barely sustain itself, even during the Khrushchev thaw, their were many problems related to communism, especially with Stalin. The West today is very well off, and even if some are not as lucky as others, it's better to have someone else make $150,000 dollars and you make $70,000 a year in america, versus being shot for not making 200 iphones per hour in china. You see, nothing good comes out of communism. Look at all the soviet satellite states! They all went on strikes, or revolted! Even the sino-soviet split! their are a few bad things about capitalism, but at least you can put a hamburger on your plate, rather then having it ""distributed"" among the ""people"".",1
11,It has been proven over and over and over again in history; communism is oppressive and in the end creates a very poor population and a oppressive ruling class. It cannot function with free thinking people. Everyone must adhere to group think and sacrifice everything for the party/cause of communism.,1
11,"Commies are mums gay I hear the drums echoing tonight But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation She's coming in, 12:30 flight The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation I stopped an old man along the way Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""",1
11,"Sounds kind of nice that everybody will be treated equally, but it doesn't happen. The communist government takes away anything you have anytime they want to and you have no rights. You end up like the poor people in N Korea! Starving, tortured and absolutely no rights. While there’s no perfect man made government, Capitalism is the best.",1
11,VERY UNETHICAL. It is unethical for the government to take money from people who have worked hard to earn the money and give it to people who don't work. The economy will never grow and people will not work. Communism is a very bad idea and it is not good for the society.,1
11,"The idea of Communist is good with everyone getting the same share of resources and items, is a good idea in concept except the only way Communism to work is if it is all or nearly all the people agree to the idea while having a well developed idea of how other governments work. Also since the state has direct control over the distribution of resources it can be easy for leader to abuse this powers without anyone realizing it which can promote a fascist/doctoral government and humans don't all willingly share everything so it would have to be forced.",1
11,"Well, on paper, it's genius. In practice, however, it's not. Take all known Communist countries as example. Russia was impoverished, poor, and tyrannical. It wasn't until they embraced Capitalism they started to build up with a decent economy. Same with North Korea, however they have never embraced Capitalism. China also is Communist but hold a great amount of Capitalistic views. Now, they have one of the greatest economies on Earth.",1
11,"You might think that communism has never worked for the reason that in most communistic societies the leader is a fascist or it's more like a dictatorship. But this is what the extreme right and left both achieve or end up becoming: a dictatorship. Communism supports left ideologies and therefor freedom of speech is going to be very restrictive, and no true democracy will ever from where the people are 100% in charge. Communism is too easy to abuse and therefor we should stay away from it.",1
11,"Every notable instance of a Communist state has failed tragically, and resulted in the death of thousands or millions of its own citizens at the hands of its government. China and Russia are the obvious, and most notable examples. What would make a successful Communist state? I've seen others suggest that all prior Communist states were simply not Communist, that's just a fallacy. Those who suggest that it could ever really work seem to be chasing an nightmare rather than a Utopian dream.",1
11,"Under communism, the hard working people, who have studied for years, and worked especially hard, cannot reap rewards from their hard work in the future, and instead lazy people who can't be bothered get the exact same as them. This discourages the hard working, and then quality of goods and services decreases.",1
11,"It is responsible for more deaths than any other ideology in history. Throughout the regimes of Mao and Stalin as well as pol pot and others, it is estimated that over 100 million were worked to death or just killed. Communism is also responsible for the destruction of many economies, such as Venezuela. A country once praised by the commie god himself Bernie Sanders. Venezuela is home to some of the largest oil reserves, but cannot provide heat or gas to its people. Millions are rioting and starving. These are just a few examples, there are many more.",1
11,"If communism were to be enacted humanity's growth would be stunted, and we would be no better than animals. Communism is also bad because it makes a state easily collapse because business and economic growth is not encouraged, and if a state were to become communist right now they would be destroyed by the UN. Also a corrupted capitalist state is better than a poor, non-productive communist state. Why? Because in a capitalist state people can really be whatever they want to be. Nothing holds you back from being rich, famous, kind, generous, or helpful to humanity. Communism makes it so if you're born within the already famous or influential 1% you will be happy, but if you aren't you will have the income and potential of a trench digger (no offense to them) no matter how hard you try.",1
11,"Well when everyone has what they want then they become whiny pieces of shit, kind of like American children. Imagine a whole country where this was encouraged faggot. I can't believe this question even exists. Just take a look at any country that used to have communism. See how they worked out.",1
11,"It literally has been tried dozens of times in countries across the world, developed and undeveloped. It is simply incapable of functioning with the way humans are designed. Greed, envy, jealousy, lust, power, and not to mention the fact that no one is equal to anyone in reality. And if everyone is equal... Why are their leaders? That means that someone has more power then you do, so it's not really communism, is it? The only way to have no leaders would be anarchy, which means their would be no government so their couldn't be communism. It also presents a negative economic situation that, unless the target country controls much of the world's production (EG. China), is constantly in decline. It does not produce a functioning society, and forces the people under it's regime to live under a police state with little to no freedoms. How anyone could support a regime such as this, I am not sure. IT DOES NOT WORK.",1
11,"The most notorious example of forced collectivization is the land reform carried out by Soviets between 1928 and 1933. It was thought that collectivization would maximize the use and potential of the countryside for urban and industrial needs. Russian industry was just taking off, and enormous quantities of food would be required for the workers.",1
11,"Take the USSR, China, or North Korea for example. They were or are responsible for the loss of countless lives. Although it was partially due to horrible leadership, it was also due to the lack of wealth of the people. If only a few people live comfortable lives in an overpopulated country, their would not be enough wealth for everyone. Most people who say yes are thinking of socialism, where the government provides for the people, like in Canada, which is still democratic.",1
11,"Although communism says that everybody is equal, that is never true. their will always be a leader or tyrant, making the government decisions for the country, and other important decisions like that. Others argue that you can work hard to be successful, but how is that fair for the lazy ones. Why should these 2 different types of workers, be paid equally.",1
11,"I think communism is great because it is good, iT make me happy that usa is communism, just like my friend stalin. I wish he was still alive, my dad knowed him maybe when I die I will meet him in the afterlife please no hate my comment, I need friends",1
11,If communism were a person it would be Christopher Colbert. He is a useless dictator who can't get past his own greed. All of his wealth comes from the people and he is reliant on everyone else. This is why i believe communism is bad and should not exist in a modern society,1
11,"Look at the other communist places, they are bad. People are killed in communist societies, hitler and north korea is terrible, now I need word count so I'll copy paste this Look at the other communist places, they are bad. People are killed in communist societies, hitler and north korea is terrible, now I need word count so I'll copy paste this",1
11,"Communism and the attempt at establishing a utopia on Earth has lead to arguably the most brutal and violent totalitarian states in the 20th century. Some of the estimates for the amount of people that died under communism range as high as 100 million people! But the modern day Marxists in their ivory towers in academia and Champagne socialists will lament that “that wasn't real communism” that “ Stalin and Mao just didn't do it right”, you honestly think you could do it better? That the system would not collapse under the staunch reality of economics and human nature?",1
11,"When the resources and sovereignty of a people has all been centralized, the ones with the power over the resources will control the other people completely. Which ain't equality, kiddies. With Communism checks and balances always disappears and a dictator almost always emerges ...And stays their! The very system becomes an insatiable cancer that deprives it's members... And then spreads as rot sluffs off. I'll take my chances with the economy being a free market and with a government that has effective checks and balances to protect me from a-holes that get too powerful.",1
11,"Communism is the leading most terrible ideology in human kind. Listen, we can have equal rights. Without being poor and forced to work for a living. it's called being ethical. Government has nothing to do with that. Sooo all and all. ""You are as strong as your weakest link""",1
11,"Sure everyone would be equal but when you think about it, a homeless man would be making just as much as a hard working doctor. Why should my hard work not pay off? I like the message it spreads but I just don't think it could work as well as people want.",1
11,Take this for example two men are stuck in a pit with one ladder they are fighting over the ladder then communism comes along and says here let me help and it cuts the ladder in half so both men have an equal share but they are equally stuck. Plus communism creates poverty because if some one working the hard job gets paid the same as an easy job they don't want to work anymore because of it,1
11,"OK there are many different arguments and I will respect that. I believe communism isn't totally bad especially if you have a good governmental leader. But I would say it's kinda hard to achieve it today due to the fact that there's 7 billion people on this planet. As many people said: Communism takes away your rights as a Human: - Yes I say this because Communism doesn't care about freedom. In fact your practically forced into working jobs you would rather not do. The Utopia that is promised with this sacrifice never comes because it doesn't exist. The government becomes an authoritarian Fascist one. It creates struggle for those who work hard: - Yep, don't work hard during communism guys, you'll get paid the same anyways. Endless revolution: - their will always be someone with too much money and people will cry about it. Starvation: - with a lot of people to feed, it's hard to have communism. This is because most of the time the government will collectivize farms. Death: Communism has brought the deaths of nearly 100 million people in the past 100 years. Communism can only be achieved in small communities.",1
11,"The greatest freedom is economic freedom. That social mobility allows you to better your life. In central planning and rationing systems that opportunity is removed, your life is in the hands of those in power. In today's world that means Trump gets to choose what and how much you eat",1
11,"I just going to say this quickly. Communism looks like a great system on paper, however is does not account for human nature. It is human nature for people to become power-hungry. You can't expect a whole population to fall in line and work. their will be mistakes and things will not work. Communism also gets rid of a work ethic. People will not work if they are getting nothing out of it. People are selfish in nature. They work for the betterment for themselves and not for their country. Trust me, not everyone will fall in with this system, and if you think they do, then you are not smart.",1
11,"You, my good sir, are an uneducated person. If you think communism fights corruption then you really have no idea what you're talking about. I agree that communism is an extremely good system on paper. When it is put into action it always fails, because of corruption. So when you say that it ""fights corruption"", it is quite the opposite. As for ""apathetic behavior"" you say that it ""fights apathetic behavior"", but I really don't understand that. It is similar to the statement that you stated earlier saying that communism ""encourages work ethic"" is completely wrong. When people are working for themselves they have more of a ""drive"" to work harder because they are working for themselves. While communism supports people working for other people not just themselves. As soon as it becomes apparent that you will get the same benefits or pay as someone doing less work then you the system will fail. When you say ""vote now"" what does that even mean? Do you mean that people should try and change their current system for communism? Is there even a vote to do that? I don't think so. If this is your true opinion then you are truly stupid.",1
11,"I think that communism wouldn't work because then there would be no point in working as hard as anyone else to get paid the same. The thing about humanity is that most of us would rather do less work for the same amount then more work for THE SAME AMOUNT. The reason people work hard is to get a good job, earn good money, and be successful . All of those things are impossible with communism. I like the idea of everyone being equal though",1
11,"Communism will not work in the past, present, or future. But Elijah Adams of St. Joseph, Missouri thinks otherwise. You see Elijah greatly believes that communism is the way to go because we have the technology in today's modern world to achieve it. And he believes it is one step closer to creating a peaceful society.",1
11,"The totalitarian culture of Marxism is truly barbaric. Under every Communist nation that has ever existed, the restrictions on the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom of the press and the freedom of religion (Enforcing state-sponsored atheism for example) are truly enormous and the impact on future generations is always negative. Name me ONE democratic communist society.",1
11,Communism doesn't work ever the only way china managed to grow its economy was by using capitalism and reproducing constantly. Also Mao Zedong literally killed 100 million people communism is the promise of all people having equal stuff. People end up hungry and dying just because you think it will work. Capitalism lifted most people above the poverty line and has made life much better through innovation.,1
11,Communism(with some minor exceptions) has never actually worked in society. It has been tried by many governments but it never actually worked for one simple reason. It doesn't take human nature into account. It doesn't take into account the fact that their will always be one asshole that wants more.,1
11,Because i'm American and i like money and big cars and big houses and women and i don't want someone saying i can't have that. If i wanna live like that i will and i can because i live in a capitalist society. I love the us baby home of the free land of the brave,1
11,"Communism is the worse idea to have ever come through a human being's mind. I cannot understand why people think communism is a good way to live. it's not. Communism promises freedom and individual equality, but this is not the case. The government in a communist society does not, in fact, give you anything it promises. You are not able to live out the life you want; the government makes you live out the life they want you to live. Why do people accept this? They accept it out of fear. Fear is what keeps the citizens in check. Fear being the only thing keeping the government in power. The government brainwashes the citizens into thinking they are in good hands, when in reality they are not. The government uses many tactics to scare the people into obedience. Including, but not limited to, starvation, torture, mass genocide, hangings, and executions. Communism is not good for any society. It would never work for even a society of a hundred people. Communism sounds good on paper, yes, but it will never work outside of paper and pencil.",1
11,"The government controls everything, no one really has any freedom. They are all brainwashed into thinking they have freedom, even though they are forced to live out the lives that the government tells them to live. Not the lives the people want to live. The government also will have horrible, inhumane ways of controlling their people. Starvation, being one of them. their is quite possibly no better way to control and brainwash people with starvation, besides mass murder. Which is another big reason why communism is not the way to go. You could be living in a communist country thinking that your brainwashed life is going swell, when suddenly two of your siblings are murdered. For what reason? None. there is no reason for that. Like they say, ""Communism kills"". Also, another point, where's your property? Oh, wait. You don't own any. According to a communist government, YOU ARE THE PROPERTY. You have no rights to own any sort of property. When I say you own nothing, I mean nothing to the fullest meaning. You don't even own your body. The government could sell it if they really wanted to. You can't even work to gain some property to own. And when you work, you don't even get the amount of money you think you deserve. No matter how hard you work, the government decides how much you get paid. Communism is not the way to go.",1
11,"Communism is kinda dumb. If you worked your butt off for 16 hours, and some other guy who worked for 2 hours got the same amount as you, you'd be pretty ticked. Communism is only preached by those who couldn't make it in the beautiful capitalist system that America has.",1
11,Communism is socialism same as the nazionalSocialists aka nazis. Therefore both totalitarian and both very bad for any country. Fascist Mussolini was also socialist and member of the italian communist party at the beginning of his life. In conclusion all socialist parties are tied with communist madness that's why people should avoid them as plague.,1
11,"Communism has caused the cannibalism of Hong Kong, Caused The Chinese Communist party to become ultra corrupt and they've covered up disasters such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square Attacks (where the liberation army killed dozens of innocent people peacefully protesting about democracy, fair trials, freedom of speech etc) and the Whenzoughou high speed terrorist attacks inside mainland china. Also if it wasn't for communism then we wouldnt of had the cold war (1960 - 1989/90) or things on the cheap, courtesy of China's failing economy where chinese companies have an unfair advantage over everyone else.",1
11,"Yes, in theory, communism is a great form of government. In theory. In practice, communism discourages work by not rewarding those that work more or put more effort into their work, puts power in the hands of so few, that it could be considered a dictatorship, and has never worked in practice. Yes, in a perfect society where no human being has any emotions or sense of self-preservation, communism could work. But, in the real world, it simply can't and won't.",1
11,"The principle of communism is great. Ideally we wan't all people to be treated the same and all money distributed evenly. But when humans get involved the system is too easy for someone to take advantage of and Impose total control. It only works if people don't want to have more power than other people and that is ,realistically, never going to happen.",1
11,"To attempt to enforce equal outcome, you must inherently take away equal opportunity. Some people are at a disposition to do better than others. So some people must have some opportunity taken away, and that never ends in a peace outcome. Someone must enforce this, and it is always the government. When the government starts to take control over people's rights, a totalitarian state is formed. When that happens as we all know, the will of the people is suppressed and dictated by their leaders. This can very easily lead to people revolting against their government which leads to people having been imprisoned and killed.",1
11,"Mao and Stalin killed million of their own people in the name of communism. Capitalism is a lot better because it works for the people and no one is ever equal. One person is always better at something else or worse then the next people at something but the same rank is simple not possible. Look at North Korean who can't even feed its own people, Cuba who needed help from the united states,China which doesn't even unhold the economic values of communism and just turned capitalist with the free market letting companies grow which is a result of Capitalism.",1
11,"The theory of communism is that everyone is equal and should be treated equally. School is free, healthcare is free, you get handed a free home, so many things are free! Sounds great right? Well actually, when this gets played in reality it isn't. Speaking of all the free things, everything has a price on it. To make these things free someone has to pay for it right? Yes, it starts out that the government goes through our stored cash to pay for them, once their storage is empty then what? They tax us until we are so poor we cant even buy food. Then when all our money is gone they start making massive piles of debt. And the debt becomes too much and the country falls apart. Communism says everyone is equal so they treat everyone in a very radical equal way. We all get payed something around $25 every couple weeks at the job we work at, doctors get paid the same income as people who mow lawns, and we are all equally poor. This isn't equality, this is just unfair! And even worse. The only rich people are the government. They get paid spoiled rich wages so actually communism is that everyone BUT the government are equal. Free speech in communist countries is very little. You have to speak very politically correct or you can be arrested. If you say ANYTHING bad against the government you can get a life sentence or even executed. And you barely have any freedom in general. You can't leave your country, you can't work hard and become rich, you cant express your thoughts. It is terrible! Everyone's a little tiny peasant who eats, (sometimes starves to death) works, and sleeps. Over and over and over. Is that the life you want to life? You want to be a politically correct zombie? No. You know you don't. You want to live a free and prosperous life and you know it. That's about all I will say for now, their are much more bad things about communism but I cant state them all. So thanks for reading anyway.",1

11,"Communism makes it so that the people who don't make a lot of money can feed off of the people who can make a lot. So, if you make a lot of money, you just have to give it all to the slackers of the community even though you worked hard for that money.",1
11,"Man was created equal and is a very common belief in many religious teachings, hence the reason why I believe that communism is what best for the world . Saying ""a doctor shouldn't get paid the same as a farmer"" is the same as saying ""women should not get paid the same as men"". Non-Communist Parties induce and create the ""wage gap"" and in order to ""eliminate"" the wage gap we have to ""eliminate"" Non-Communism.",1
11,"Look at the world leading power, America. Is that a communist country, no, and non-communist places are kind of like teaching you to work hard to earn enough money to support yourself. The fact that everyone gets paid equally, you can just work like a fatso and still get paid the same amount. Also, if the country isn't doing well then you aren't doing well, and right their is poverty. Sure everyone gets paid equally and maybe it reduces poverty but, greedy and corrupt people are out their and if that person becomes one, you are not going to have a good time.",1
11,"In a communist country you say everyone gets paid the same right.Well we all might get paid the same but why would someone be a doctor if the janitor is going to get paid the same?So you might think that ""Well maybe they are passionate towards being a doctor"" well did you know that more than 65% of the people who work are not passionate about their jobs.So one might say that you are equal but you truly are not equal.",1

When a need is seen, it is filled, and if people or governments don't have a motivation to make, produce, or provide a good or service, it will not happen. On the other hand, markets provide incentives and rewards for those whose ideas are helpful.",1
11,"USSR- communist ""republic"", responsible for tens of millions of dead civilians, gotta love the gulags, almost no rights, propaganda EVERYWHERE PRC- also communist, responsible for even more civilian deaths then the USSR, suppressed protests with military force (including tanks, just google ""tank man""), also no rights, Mao Zedong is their god DPRK- do I even need to say it? You can search up all of the stories of people who escaped on your own time, but let's just leave it as basically everyone is forced to be vegetarian, mass killing, Jong Un killed his own Uncle, etc. Cambodia- massive genocide killing three million civilians and opposition Here's some extra socialist goodies for you guys Venezuela- streets ruled by gangs, massive crime rate, everyone except for the government and crime bosses has to eat extremely rationed food",1
11,"For starters, ideologically speaking, communism seems like a good solution for the underbelly of industrialization, however, it is far from being pragmatic. From an economic perspective, communism cannot function simply because it does not allow for business to flourish, so there isn't a good source for money. Even if you make the argument that in an ideal communist society money wouldn't matter because the state would provide you with your needs, then I must inquire, how will the state pay for things? Even if you do say that everyone will give what they have to the state so that it can be fairly distributed, then how are they going to get the stuff? The point is that expecting a communist society to flourish economically is unrealistic because it's like expecting for a care to keep on running forever without giving it gas, it just doesn't work. The reason why the USSR collapsed is because of economic problems. Communism can't work for a host of other reasons, but from even just an economic perspective, it simply does not work.",1
11,"In a perfect society where everyone is looking out for everyone's best interest, then yes, communism is a fantastic idea. However, this isn't a perfect society and human nature makes us greedy. If I knew that I wouldn't have to work but still get the same thing as someone who has a PHD in neuro brain science, then I wouldn't work. Everyone nowadays want everything for free without working.",1
11,"Communism, in its roots, has to deal with communal practice. Everyone works, and everyone gives, and everyone receives. Humans are all so different, some are constantly diligent, some are downright lazy, some are just moderate. Humans cannot work like ants, we need government. With ants and bees, they are the true communists, selfless, determined and needs based on instinct, not want. Ants and bees can function like they do due to their physiology. They emit chemicals that tell what they are feeling, and do this out of instinct. The chemicals they produce function like voting altogether and working together without conflict. Humans don't have that luxury, for as long as their are humans, their will be difference, and through difference comes conflict. History and biology back my claims.",1
11,Basically fascists are the superior ideology right now. Personally I think that we should forget about democracy and communism and all become nationalist socialists. We will have equal rights and their will be glory for the fatherland. We shall never accept the communist beliefs among our proud aryan population!,1
11,"All of you privileged little kids have to understand that your good life in this capitalistic society would go to crap. Giving a whole country's power to one group of people it goes very corrupt. their is a countless number of scandals that have happened in the Soviet Union. Overall, imagining that you can just give a handful of people power over to 300,000,000 people is insane. The average weight people living in russia was <40 pounds. People had no food, when their family members died, they had to eat them. All of you are so privileged and don't understand a single thing about politics.",1
11,"Honestly, Communism just sounds like a fairy tale. Everyone is equal, everyone has a job, everyone is happy, and everyone is willing to do what it takes to do their part in society. However, the problem is that human beings are greedy. When everyone is equal, people try to do anything they can do to break that and become the top. For example, Stalin from the Soviet Union. He ended up being like a dictator. That wasn't supposed to happen if everyone is equal, no? Besides, think about this. No matter how hard you work, no matter how hard of a job you have, you're going to get paid the same amount as a lazy person. For example, if you are a heart surgeon and you save lives as a job, you get paid the same amount as a person that sits down and checks emails. Finally, Communism KILLED 100 MILLION PEOPLE. Have you heard of the Tiananmen Square Massacre? College students gathered to protest against Communism, and the government literally sent in tanks as if it's a freaking war zone! In conclusion, Communism is an awesome theory thats has good intentions, but when put to place, is terrible. Didn't work in history, means it won't work now.",1
11,"The sound of Communism is enticing to people such as the lower class because they are told they will all be equal with their upper class counterparts. The truth is that the idea of communism isn't bad, it's just how it's set up. The government has too much control over people. Simply said, Communism works until the government gets power hungry.",1
11,"Communism has achieved nothing but mass starvation, extreme poverty, terrible living standards, a severe lack of freedoms and the deaths of up to 49 million people under Stalin. Communism would have you believe that success is a bad thing. If you make too much money and create too much wealth for yourself, you are stealing from the government and the people. However, if you pay for other people's sh*t, and if you give up your hard earned wealth, and if you have your rights taken from you at gunpoint - that's not stealing because it's from the government? Capitalism is simply the greatest system of government ever created. Anybody, and I mean ANYBODY has the capacity to work hard and achieve whatever it is they desire. Capitalism has provided more freedoms, lifted more people out of poverty, made more people happy and satisfied with life, created more jobs, spawned more inventions and innovations and saved more lives than any other system of government ever created. Including communism.",1
11,"Human nature includes very basic forms of greed and drive to be better then others thus communism has an instant flaw in it's makeup. To maintain a proper communist state would be to attempt to catch a greased pig. Possible but highly unattainable and difficult to maintain. This is a basic flaw that we have seen countless times, even in more basic egalitarian societies such the ancient Indus Valley. Even when basic order was attained it was followed by a steady decline due to corruption and the aforementioned natural human traits.",1
11,"Regardless if if were perfectly implemented or not, it would still fail. It goes against human nature that is not going to change anytime soon. Regardless of failed governments look at that vegan restaurant in Grand Rapids. It was supposed to be operated like a communist society. It folded. If a restaurant can not make it, how could all of human civilization.",1
11,"The issue being that most people are just greedy, we live in a capitalist society where if you don't make it your own, well then too bad, someone else will gladly take your place, we're born in bred to believe that the more money we make the happier we are and that's how society has worked and unfortunately will always work, it's just how it is, Modern day Communism will fail due to its own flaws and failures, capitalism may not be the best solution, but then again, at least in our side we can practice what we believe in without being gunned by police",1
11,"The Utopian Communism described by Marx is completely untrue, communism gives all the power to the government creating a dictatorship every time and communism punishes hard work by making everyone have equal pay. Every country that has embraced communism has miserably failed because if their is no incentive to work, no work will be don't.",1
11,"In one farm, you have Communism. Everybody gets paid 7 an hour, no matter how hard they work. In the other, you have Capitalism. If you don't work, you get nothing. The harder you work, the more you get. The hard workers will go to the Capitalism farm, for they will get paid way more than 7 an hour. The people who don't work at all will go to the Communist farm because they will get 7 an hour no matter what. WHICH FARM WOULD PRODUCE MORE?????",1
11,"Humans and human nature are inherently filled with vices, and it is completely impossible to be a perfect human being. Communism, whilst it may seem like a good idea, is such a weak system that is is ALWAYS abused by those with vices. It is an inherently stupid system that relies on the goodness of human beings to exist, despite the fact that the goodness of human beings is practically nonexistent when it comes to places of high power.",1
11,"Millions of people have died due to abusive communist leaders such as Stalin and Mao. Some say ""real communism has not been achieved yet"" but if that is the case then when will it ever be achieved? Communism will always end up becoming a tool for oppression. An idealistic ideology that always fails in it's execution.",1
11,"What do you think about when you hear communism? If you think it's good, you're correct in some ways but not all. Communism mustn't be good if only 7 countries use it (Cuba, Syria, Turkmenistan, China, Laos, Vietnam and North Korea itself being the worse.) I say no to this because democracy has 4 things that keep it standing (justice, freedom, equity and representation.) Communism is good when it comes to equality but equity better and would you want your leader taking advantage of their power? Reply if you do.",1
11,"If I spend thousands of dollars by going to university to get a degree and someone working at McDonalds with no degree made the same amount of money as me, I would not be motivated to go to work or to perform well.

It would be horrific.",1
11,Kim jong un is horrible he punishes people without second thought he is cruel and only wants to increase his power and wealth and sending everyone who opposes him to work camps and even punishes generations after them by making them work to and the food that goes through the country goes through the army through the distribution center then to the people. This shows that communism is bad and can be corrupted.,1

11,"If north korea is communist it shows how bad it is. Communism might represent order, communism has gone down since the 50's because of this. Communism, as well as everything else, is boring. Everyone gets exactly the same treatment and It is often said if we were all the same, life would be boring. Communism is also bad for the economy and on the individuals health. And although it claims to be fair, communism means everyone gets paid the same no matter how hard they work",1
11,"If you gave everyone the same amount of money some would spend it all, some spend most, others save most which would lead once again to a capitalist underground that ALL communists countries have. there is no way possible to make everyone equal unless your goal is to make the majority equally poor and equally miserable.",1
11,there is no freedom! We get to have our own opinions and speak them! All communism does is fight and fight! We need peace around here! We get to go to stores and buy toilet paper and all the things we have but over their in other countries such as CHINA is really bad! Too much poverty! I say this because I live in the USA it's not fair!,1
11,"Communism is the worse ideology of all time. Examples:every communist country. Due to the fact that everything is provided by the state people don't need to work as hard, thus productivity is significantly lowered. Since there is no competition very little innovations are made. Both of these hinder economic growth greatly. We need democracy to.Limit power. If you look at the PRC compared to the ROC you evidently see hoe communism fails. Ever since mao died and china is just communist in name millions have been lifted out of poverty by the free market. That is my argument. If you think communism works, I'm sorry, but you are not in touch with the real world.",1
11,"Communism drives the people to be equal. While that may look good on paper and all the planning that occurred to execute the program, it will make the people to be average and lazy. And it's boring as hell. You're not allowed to have your own bike, everyone has to have their own bike. You're not allowed to be special, people gets bored of it immediately.",1
11,"If communism ever actually succeeded, then yes theoretically everyone would be equal and society would be good. But you HAVE to have a leader for people to work without fighting. People naturally group to leaders. If everyone is equal then their can not be a ruling class/elite/body. It would be anarchy to get rid of the government. The people rely on the government. Also if you got £1000 would you not like to keep it? If you were communist every penny or cent if you american would be handed out to everybody. Should doctors be paid the same as a bin man?",1
11,"Communism is good theoretically. However, it's very bad if you bring it to practice. I live in a communist country. You couldn't imagine how corrupted it is. You have to work hard to gain money but you have to share it with other people. What if these people are lazy? Then is it unfair to you? Some people might take it as their advantage, living on others hard work. That's how my government works. Also, Communist government is ran by working class. In ideology, it makes society fairer, everyone can run the country, everyone can have the right to lead their people. But please! We have to admit the the working class have the least education in policy, economy, etc. The people in that class can lead the whole country in the wrong way! For example, China, Cambodia in the first years of communism. We need politicians who have studied, learned the knowledge of running the country in the right way. That's what makes a nation become powerful. Giving your whole country, your people to someone who used to be working, have little education is very risky. In conclusion, I think communism is good in ideology, but in practice, it's hard to make it fair to everyone like it says in books. their is always corruption in practice.",1
11,"That's the beauty of free enterprise. If a company does something outrageous, boycott. Not paying enough? Boycott. Polluting a lake? Boycott. In Communism? You just have to hope the people in government aren't corrupt. Not to mention, it has failed so many times in the past. Simple put, man is a free being. Trying to change that is unscientific, ideological, and simply put, STUPID.",1
11,"Just look at venezuela. No food on the shelves. Riats all the time. Even in soviet Russia, Stalin would just kill people because he was a paranoid. there was censorship and no freedom of speech and their is no motive to work. You get paid no matter how hard or how not hard you work.",1
11,"it's good on papers and theory in my opinion, however every country that applied it, right out suck and even the country that theorized it - Russia (formerly USSR) can't stand it and changed it. China for example is full of corruption and the government spread out propaganda that fools the citizens, and don't get me start with the China's level of censor....",1
11,Communism is good I theory. It will work with a small amount of people but not a gigantic mass of people like the whole world. People who are hard working like doctors who spend years in university will only get the same as someone the could be super lazy and couldn't be bothered studying. I don't think it's fair for the hard workers,1
11,"If I were to go to Oxford or another prestigious school, and if I were to get a great job, I would be paid the same as a person who dropped out of their school. Absolutely unfair! I don't understand how you can build a society based around this in any way.",1
11,"Even though people are guaranteed a job, the state has sponsored standardized tests, which some choose their following schools. So if someone excelled in Mathematics and Science the State would only put them into schools specialised to teach them one job. Meaning that the State technically chooses the jobs they're going to have as they're still young. The State just puts people in jobs that are needed to be don't. Even if they're not good at it. Even if people do get Jobs they like and are good at, all jobs, easy or hard get the same or about the same amount of pay, which still isn't much.",1
11,"My argument is more or less the same as the rest you have read on this site. Communism makes it so that people who would otherwise have great ideas and motivation, would lose the will to make these ideas reality, due to the simple fact that they can't CAPITALIZE their idea, therefore, stunting the growth of society all because they won't make any damn money off of their innovations.",1
11,I don't think that communism is good because for example if our officials are corrupt then they could all of our money easily because in communism all of your money is owned by the government and it will distributed equally to your countrymen. The question is what if our leader is corrupt? Then there's nothing left for the people.,1
11,"Democratic communism, aka: socialism, doesn't work (take a look at Europe) Marxist, or Stalin Communism, leads to millions of live to be taken away to enforce the law, to famine due to poor production. Also communism has been associated with Atheism and persecution of religious groups (take a look at the USSR, and North Korea).",1
11,"History is replete with the failures of communism. It has been the most significant cause of death, destruction and misery during the past century. Any system that does not reward society members for their effort / innovation will be doomed to failure. Eventually the balance of takers and producers overwhelms the ability of society to produce enough to support society. The deck in a communist society is stacked so that the only wealth members end up being the government officials who are in power. Look at the USSR, China, Vietnam, Cambodia etc.",1
11,"The thing is, communism doesn't work in a society where merit and hard work is rewarded. Instead, communism just rewards citizens equally, irregardless of effort and hard work. Besides, so far none of the communist countries have attained what Marx and Engels envisioned, a state where everyone is equal, including citizens and rulers. it's just an excuse for them to cling on to power, while the state's people starve to death. Oh and another thing, communism can never work in a world where bilateral cooperation is needed. Self-sufficient states ( like the former People's Republic of Kampuchea) will ultimately fail, as this requires the state to be isolated from trade.",1
11,"Let's put it this way: If you steal a candy bar, instead of paying for it and maybe some community service, you are assassinated. A communist country deals too harsh punishments to innocent people. Too many people think that this type of government is the right choice, including Obama. So stay free, America.",1
11,"Communism may be good on paper, but if you don't add anything to society then your first fallback will always be communism. Americans all agree, look at how the contest between the USSR and USA went during the cold war. The Soviet Union didn't collapse because of ""capitalist pigs"", it collapsed because nobody produced anything. America, however, rewards hard work and discourages not working.",1
11,If communism would be instituted in a place such as america the typical freedom and you can own many things would be gone. Because everyone owns everything you won't have any belongings and you would be required to work countless hours of hard labor even if you are an intellect. Would you really want to live a life where you own practically nothing and all you did in life was hard labor.,1
11,Come on a communist government is bad the government would own everything there was no private property because the government owned it all I mean come on people think for example stalin took farmland from the poor when their was communist government do you want your land taken away from you,1
11,"Although each person has certain unalienable rights that should never be taken away, we are not all equal, each person is created different, some ways good some ways bad. A communist society tries to level the playing field, and in turn try to fight our basic human instincts of bettering ourselves in order to live fuller and happier. To say that America is failing due to a capitalist society is false, we are failing due to crony capitalism as well as a lack of open markets allowing smaller businesses to succeed. I could name a great number of communist societies that have failed within the lifetime of America, but yet were still here? it's not a perfect system, and there should be certain socialist programs set in order to help those that have no other options, but communism is not the answer.",1
11,Imagine a world where a lot of people do nothing but still gets something the same as the hard workers do. Is it good? If it is good for you then you are an idiot. Communism is not good for the society. It only sounds good but i know that a lot of people will hate it if they experienced if first hand. I did. And it's really undoubtedly stupid. It only favors the lazy people.,1
11,"Communism isn't fair to the people who are hard working. They would get the same as the slackers of society. Also, communism suppresses creativity and innovation in the country.

11,"It has been proven throughout the course of history, that communism and it's ideals have never worked. It doesn't work because in theory, everyone is supposed to hold their own and work towards a greater good, but, in reality, people catch on to the fact that, they don't need to work, and they still get the same things that the hard worker gets. It also is a politically failing theory because it doesn't allow anyone to succeed, no one can better themselves and no one can create a better then decent life for their family.",1
11,"Communism is not a good thing to a country, because I see it too extreme. Communists want to get communism to a country using whatever works, even killing sometimes. Communism is also easily totalitarian. What I think is good is Socialism which is totally good and so much better than capitalism (sorry for my English)",1

With communism, no one is going to want to do jobs that are hard, dangerous, physically demanding, or require one to work at night, (think: hospital workers, trash collectors, policemen , construction workers that build our roads, buildings, bridges, and highways, trains, infrastructure. No one is going to sweat their ass off in the hot sun putting down hot tar pavement on our roads, for example. If everyone is paid the same, what is the incentive to work hard ? These people should be paid much MORE because they are doing jobs no one else wants to do, and rightly so. MONEY is the only thing that will make people take these kinds of jobs. It also stifles innovation and creativity, because there would be NO incentive to do anything that requires a high degree of intellect and education, such as inventing cell phone, computers, etc. So unless you want to live in a shack, with no plumbing or running water, no electricity, no refrigerator, no cars or transportation, no televisions or cellphones, no medical care, or ANY modern convenience; then you need to say a big NO to communism. Communism cannot even exist for long without the technology, innovation and largesse of non-communist countries. Look at CUBA. Enough said.",1
11,"their is little or no economic growth! How can ones economy succeed with the communism system? Especially now that the economy is rising so quickly, one can't keep up.

Here is why I don't want communism: first, if you look at North Korea, you will know why... Secondly, if you are smarter than the person next to you, it will never matter because you will be all equal. Lastly, people are always greedy, and want to express themselves, so their will never be a pure communist world. If you guys come to think about it, even countries like North Korea, are not communist. Technically they are dictatorship because they have one supreme ruler. (Kim Jong Un)",1
11,"Firstly, there is no point in history whatsoever that communism has succeeded with the intentions people believe communism should be run by. Secondly, by nature, men are self-centered. People often are corrupted and influenced by power, wealth, and their assets. Naturally, as history proves to show, these people who run the communist parties succumb to their own personal wants and desires, and in no instance has that not affected the communist party, or any political party. If you assume that these people who promise great things out of communism with their only basis being their words, then that is a rather credulous thought process.",1

11,"Communism may sound good on paper but in practice it falls flat. It takes away all incentives, giving no reason for anyone to work hard or better themselves. (mainly because they cannot.) Many people who advocate communism don't understand how it truly works in society and simply look at what communism says it stands for: equality for all. Which is a simple fantasy in practice and in logic. Communism of any kind has never, is not, and will never succeed.",1

What will I feel when seeing a garbage man, who didn't spend as much on education, get the same salary that I do. And finally humans will always lust for power. it's impossible for anyone with that much power to just care about everything anyone wants him to do. It sounds great on paper, but in practice it just doesn't work out.",1

11,"Where the issue comes in is with the actual implementation of the system, and this has been emphasized with the many nations that have attempted communism. Communism puts too much power into the hand of central government, this has been displayed not only in Marxist and Communist systems but in almost every other economic system. Communism also discourages the raw ingenuity that capitalism provides, and while Marx does provide a compelling argument against such ingenuity and consumerism, the world needs these things; the pros far outweigh the cons. Capitalism does have it's many large flaws, but Communism's flaws are much more numerous and lethal to the nation of its origin in itself. You must go to Capitalism for the preservation of the union, but at the expense of class warfare and proletariat subjugation. You must go to Communism for fairness of the working class, but at the expense of creation and the nation as a whole. Which is good? Neither; they both blow hard and I wish there was a better option, but we aren't exactly close to one. Which is better? Capitalism; the lesser of the two evils.",1

11,"The idea of communism might seem nice, but really it would encourage people not to be as productive, it also mostly depends on which country. Like half of the worlds everything comes from China, so naturally distribution of money their would make sense, but in other places, like the us, communism would throw the country into chaos. Plus some people would just insist on a choice for everything, once again like the us, so a republic or democracy would better fit, or even a monarchy, where you could still elect a prime minister. It just depends on the people.",1
11,Communism is not that great for society. I think many people enjoy a democracy in society because it gives us enough freedom to make our own choices and fail and do stupid things but we still have a set of rules when it is needed and necessary. In my opinion communism does not give the same freedom.,1
11,Communism makes the original powerhouse oppress nobility to poverty and to stop arguments between sharing the powerhouse takes it for itself to make an unfair dictatorship which could ruin the country completely and destroy it's economy as the workers would be oppressed depressed tired and would not be able to work as hard as a healthy adult should.,1
11,"While communism ""might"" be fair, it's basis does not support growth very well. I would argue that capitalism has put many people in a position where even the lowest earners can live better today than any other point in history or even compared to communist countries today. Look at the purchasing power of a dollar today compared to 100+ years ago. Back then you worked all day to just put food on the table and pay for a place to live and maybe have a little left over to save up for that new cooking pot you need or the axe to cut firewood to keep your home warm in the winter. Today in america it's not that hard for a low wage earner to afford housing (most expensive), electricity, heating ( and you don't always have to chop wood), air conditioning, cell phones, internet, some from of television entertainment (at least netflix), food (mostly fast food these days and plentiful), and after all that you can still save a little money to eventually buy computers, electronics, tools, furniture, bath and beauty products, appliances or even a vehicle or 2. Most of these items and the ability to afford all this today is thanks to capitalism. Ask yourself how many of the products you buy were developed buy communist countries? Granted a lot of products (ie China) are made in some communist countries but it still comes back to capitalism and even those countries have benefited a great deal thanks to it. You also have to give credit to capitalism for many of the things we aspire to or even simply enjoy in the virtual world. If it weren't for excessively rich people, we wouldn't have realistic racing games with cars that everyone wants but can't afford. In fact what was the last game any of you played you can think of that was made in a communist country? Capitalism sometimes hurts but in the long run it's better. Look at blockbuster, yeah it sucks all those people lost their jobs and the company went under but in this day in age do we really need it? What about the horse and buggy businesses a lot of people lost their jobs then too. But under communism the probably wouldn't have . Which would have been good for the worker but ultimately not for the consumer and ultimately while buggy manufacturing jobs went away, care manufacturing jobs increased. Btw if you price a buggy today, you'll find you can buy a fairly decent used car for about the same price and you won't have to buy a horse or spent the time and money keeping the horse fed and cared for. (gas is still cheaper then that)",1
11,"Socially, Communism could work out (IE dictatorship, no freedom of speech) but economically it fails, China is doing successful because of free trade, politically they are communist but economically they don't have communism, so imagine that you spent all your time working extra hours but got paid as much as someone who didn't work and was extremely lazy. it's an unrealistic expectation and brings in utopianism. In-fact most of the world uses capitalism today for their economy",1
11,"Communism does not work because it depends on the goodness of man. If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If men were governed by angels then it would be perfect. But since we would be governed by men then that huge amount of power often corrupts that person. Since communism shares everything that person might just take a little more for himself and a little more until he and his officials have taken so much of the best for themselves that the people under them have little or nothing.",1
11,"While it might sound good in theory, communism is not good for society. I have heard of an experiment don't with a professor and his class where he told them they would use a communist system for their grades. He averaged them all and every time people started slacking off more and more because they expected other people's grades to catch their fall. Eventually everyone walked out with a c. Even though it sounds like a ""nice peaceful"" society the same thing would happen. Everyone in their jobs being paid the same would start to slack off and nothing would be don't. People with really difficult jobs would get jealous of the people with easy jobs. As well as jobs communism suppresses culture. It would be suppressed, especially modern pop culture because it revolves individual corporations that make billions a year. Human nature is greedy. So is animal nature. their is really not a true from of altruism, there would still be big men at the top profiting. You see how other communist countries have turned out, too. The USSR, China, North Korea, etc. none of them worked.",1
11,"Communism is only good for people who are too lazy or dumb to contribute to a better world. I don't agree with billionaires who do nothing, but suck more and more money for nothing, but I think scientists or engineers (people who create something that's valuable) should be better paid then, let's say, a waiter. I don't think at all that the current system is any good, but communism is not the good alternative. People need motivation to get the best out of them, and not just live like a fish in a tank. In a truly righteous world, everyone's salary would be proportionate to the value the produce.",1
11,"I think when we 'fight for equality' we aim for this one level, one plain, one equal society that combines all people of all backgrounds onto one playing field. While this could be a good thing, how could we see the different sets of strengths and weaknesses that each person naturally has? Each person is born differently, with different skills, different interests, even different cultural backgrounds. Instead of stifling those skills, interests, and backgrounds by putting each individual on an 'equal' society, why not focus on equally treating one another with respect, dignity, and poise no matter what interests, skills, or backgrounds you have.",1
11,Sometimes the right thing to do is not the fair thing to do. With communism everyone has to share everything so you can't really own something. Some people work harder than others yet still be treated like the lazy people? Communism slows down progression because some people will work harder while others take it easy.,1
11,If you are a good worker then why would you want to work hard if someone who does not put forth any effort gets the same amount of money as you. Everyone would stop trying and that would ruin the business. It will only work if you can guarantee people trying their hardest which you cannot.,1
11,"Communism, as well as everything else, is boring. Everyone gets exactly the same treatment and It is often said if we were all the same, life would be boring. Communism is also bad for the economy and on the individuals health. And although it claims to be fair, communism means everyone gets paid the same no matter how hard they work Where the issue comes in is with the actual implementation of the system, and this has been emphasized with the many nations that have attempted communism. Communism puts too much power into the hand of central government, this has been displayed not only in Marxist and Communist systems but in almost every other economic system. Communism also discourages the raw ingenuity that capitalism provides, and while Marx does provide a compelling argument against such ingenuity and consumerism, the world needs these things; the pros far outweigh the cons. Capitalism does have it's many large flaws, but Communism's flaws are much more numerous and lethal to the nation of its origin in itself. You must go to Capitalism for the preservation of the union, but at the expense of class warfare and proletariat subjugation. You must go to Communism for fairness of the working class, but at the expense of creation and the nation as a whole. Which is good? Neither; they both blow hard and I wish there was a better option, but we aren't exactly close to one. Which is better? Capitalism; the lesser of the two evils.",1
11,"If everybody gets the same amount of money, Then why would you work hard for innovation and creativity? People get the amount of money according to their needs, Then how could you make sure that they're not lying to get more money? If all money were to be given to the same government, How could you know if they're doing something with it that you don't know about beforehand? Some countries claim that they are communists, They're not really carrying it out because communism is supposed to lead to harmony, Instead, It lead to fear and uncertainty. Note that the question is ""is communism good for society"". It might be a good idea, But it will never work in our society.",1
11,"In a communist society, You could pour all of your time and effort into your job but you only make as much as someone who put in minimal or no effort. You would get the same payment either way. In a society like that, Why would you put in any effort to your job? The economy would crash and you would be living in one of the poorest societies in the world.",1
11,"Because everyone is paid the same no matter what, there is no incentive to work. Also, It is an excuse for the government to get too powerful. Dictators often use communism as an excuse to impede on people's' rights. Venezuela should be a rich country, Because it has huge amounts of oil, But it is so poor that it's people struggle to have their basic needs yet. Why? Because the communist government has gotten to powerful and won't leave. China is another example of how governments violate the populations' rights and use communism as an excuse.",1
11,"Just look at history and the remaining communist nations of the world to see just how bad it was. A good example is the cultural revolution in China or the Ukrainian starvation in the USSR both of which have claimed millions of lives and in China's case, Even destroyed much of it's past history. People say that there would be no conflict if everyone was equal, But there would always be someone smart and charismatic to rally people and take power. Enforcing a communist rule would either leave the world in total anarchy where murders or thefts would not be policed or enforce a brutal dictatorship where free will and thought would be suppressed.",1

A revolution of hypocrisy with false promises resulting in nothing but death, Misery and suffering.",1
11,"Just Google ""Kulak"" and learn what Communism is. And then, Compare that to the Capitalism you know. The problem with Capitalism is that it needs to be regulated. Regulated Capitalism is the best system in the world, And by a large margin. Where do you think you got the digital device you are reading this on, From? A Capitalist made this happen. Capitalism has been a giant leap forward for society. We are free to pursue what we want and get paid what we feel we deserve. Communism has never worked. If you are under the age of 35, And think you don't need to learn from history. Then you are in for a rude awakening. It is estimated that between 75 billion to 100 billion humans have walked the Earth. Far more than are alive, Today. For example, Archimedes nearly invented calculus 2000 years ago. Independently! Who alive would be able to do that? Probably no one. The youth of today need to have respect of the wisdom from previous generations, Otherwise we will just relive the horrors of last century. Something I am not willing to do.",1

The communist will never admit what he is, He's like talking to a brick wall, As it were the same as getting rid of insects. Ronald Reagan during the 1980's fought communism, He revealed it the same way Glenn Beck did. So much insecticide was used.",1

Communism is a noose. 60 million + people have died from it!",1

Since the dawn of civilization currency and trade has been a major basis of our wellbeing as humans. The major reason why we are so successful as s people is because of our willingness to innovate and progress higher in our societies Additionally, Communism will always, In turn, Cause totalitarianism because there are no reasonable means to ""cease the means of production"" without being violent. Additionally, How does one control a massive world population and ensure that they are not producing for themselves or valuing their own success? The only feasible means of doing this is through totalitarianism and as we have seen, Time and time again totalitarianism will always ultimately lead to the misery of the people.",1

However, in practice is misses one thing: people don't want to be equal. They want to win, and communism relies on the people who control the country and divide the property to not be human in nature, which is, of course, impossible. Naming a successful communist state is impossible, because they don't exist. Despite it's good intentions, communism leads to tyranny and greed, and the eventual collapse of a state.",1

12,"I understand that their will be big companies around and any system no matter how bullet proof will have flaws but from what I've seen free market capitalism seems the best for everyone when you compare it to other proposed systems around the debate (My thoughts of course, Don't know everything)",1
12,"Capitalism, especially free capitalist markets, is a successful system of unregulated markets because people vote for their business to succeed with their dollar. It provides incentives to work harder to earn a wage for the worker and provides incentive for the entrepreneur to strive to achieve his or her goals. One such example for this is Bill Gates who did not start as a wealthy man. Capitalism works as such: if you are a worker for a business then you are taking no risk to improve your stance in life economically. If the business fails, you simply go to work for another company and thus pick up the same paycheck (give or take a few dollars here due to a lot of other factors) as you were before. If you are an entrepreneur then you are taking a risk via a loan, paying out of pocket or other such methods. By taking a risk you are willing to move either up or down through the classes which is very common in the United States. People saying 'da rich get richer' are just full of themselves and Liberal propaganda. If a company in a true free market economy fails there is no government bailout (which by the way, we pay for in our taxes as a regulated market which means that the company has no incentive to make a good product or provide a good service). Even among the working class it is possible to obtain a higher standard of living through schooling, learning a trade or working in a stable career for a while; all of which are possible without any money to back them up as schooling can be don't through loans, Pell grants, etc and learning a trade can be don't through trade schools which (in some cases) can be negotiated with to pay off after the individual has gotten a job. Either the opposition to this argument is ignorant and needs to do far more research or they are just completely blind. there are many, MANY opportunities in a free market society. And someone mentioned America being a prime example of the rich getting richer? That's just factually false. The rich are sliding up and down between classes in America as are most of the poor. And all of what I said can be easily verified. Use your google-fu people. No one ever got rich in a communist, socialist or any other highly regulated society. Venezuela is a perfect example of what does NOT work.",1
12,"With competition, companies will be forced to create better product for its customers, leading to more jobs.

12,"Businesses are trying to make revenue by making good products with reasonable prices that consumers would support and buy, while consumers are always needing new products, responding to the products' prices to keep the prices and businesses in check. Therefore free market is good. It is a win win situation. Additionally, these businesses are not only just making money, they are also using the money to constantly innovate products and meet the consumers need, which, at the same time, is pushing civilization and the economy forward.",1
12,I think the issue most people have is wealth being passed down through family to people who did not work for it. If someone does something useful to create wealth then sure let them reap the rewards. I think Inheritance is what makes it complicated.. Would they work as hard to produce as much wealth if it wasn't gonna go to their kids? Are their kids a continuation of them and therefore should benefit? Or are they a totally different person and therefore should not get such a huge head start? I think this is the most pressing issue that makes it look worse then it actually is.,1
12,"The reason the rich people have more money is because they MAKE more money. Say everyone has 1 dollar. Wealth is created and some people end up having 10 dollars. They didn't steal from everyone else, the economy grew. there's more wealth to go around in free market capitalism but it falls into the hands of the rich. it's not bad because just because one person's rich doesn't automatically mean another person's poor.",1
12,"Seriously, the only arguments opposing free market are ""oh it makes people rich but they have to work for that and I don't want to work hard because my parents didn't raise me right and I wanted everything handed to me."" A free market opens up the doors for anyone to become a successful millionaire, all you need is a business, good product, will to work hard, and you're all set.",1
12,A free market encourages hard work and innovation. It allows countries to generate wealth and jobs. All of the richest countries in the world have a free market. In China when it introduced a free market hundreds of millions were lifted out of poverty. The free market is the greatest system for removing poverty. In a free market anyone can succeed. A free market would not bailout banks. A free market has and always generate wealth bringing millions out of poverty.,1
12,"Let's look at this with an example. If I wanted to create a business making cupcakes. Then I could I would have to raise revenue by loans, or working in another job until I had the proceeds to make my dream come to fruition. Here is were free market comes in . Once I open my business and start making cupcakes...If I produce something good then customers will buy my cupcakes and show that I am putting resources to the right usage. However if I make hotdog peanut butter cupcakes and no one buys my product I will have to a) make something else and put the resources to other usages or b) close down because the consumers/customers have soon that I am wasting resources and the resources are need else were in the market. The resources are then reallocated to other areas in the economy that need/use them better then I would have. Point being class has nothing to do with capitalism. If you work had you can become just as rich as Bill Gates. He had an idea and brought it to the public. The consumers liked his produce and bought it. It was a free exchange. Because of capitalism bill gates had the chance of becoming who he is today and he took it. Anyone with the right idea can do just as much with their dream. It is when we start to put heavy regulations on companies that things start to downturn. With all the rules and hoops that people have to go through it is crazy. Not saying some of the regulations aren't need.",1
12,A unregulated economy is destined for disaster because of how dysfunctional markets are for example the recession of 2006 that happened in America was due to the boom bust boom affect in a free market.

Try telling someone in government housing and dodgy neighbourhoods that all they need to do is just ""work harder"". For these people they have been screwed by the system because in capitalism you need money to earn more money. Unless you can convince like 3 generations of poor people that all they need to do is work hard their entire lives and the final generation will not be poor anymore then they will be stuck in an institutionalised cycle. Secondly, I also think their is an inherent problem with the fact that surgeons who save lives and work for most of their awake time earn multiple times less money than actors who provide 90 minutes of entertainment at a time...",-1
12,In free market capitalism you end up with having 1 percent of the population owning 90 percent of the wealth. This is because of big businesses. It is good for a few but bad for everyone else. IT also leads to extreme inequality putting poor people in economic situations which are hard to get out of.,-1
12,"The concept of a 'free market' is false in itself. A free market follows rules and regulations that guide whom can and cannot receive loans. This leads to further inequality in classes as those with more wealth receive the greater advantage and further the separation, anxiety, and loathing that occurs in society between classes. The free market is not free at all. A free market would be available to all free citizens.",-1
12,"If we do have free-market capitalism, it will lead to higher class-inequality and exploitation of the poor strata by the rich, as seen in places like the United States today. Capitalism is not necessarily a bad element in society, however, unregulated capitalism, which is precisely what unregulated capitalism is, simply does not work. All that will happen is the rich get richer since only they have the resources to get more resources while the poor get poorer because they don't have the resources to do anything to improve their social status. Thus, free-market capitalism is very unlikely to work in any nation.",-1
12,"Because Communism takes away so many freedoms compared to Capitalism, And it is not worth getting free but lackluster services and free but cheap goods in exchange for giving up the freedoms that allow a person to be themselves they are guaranteed within the U. S. Constitution. Absolute power invokes corruption of power absolutely.

We need to get rid of racism, But not Capitalism. Drain the bath water but keep the baby!",1
12,"In a capitalistic society the consumer (everyday people) decides for themselves what they need and want and the sellers (also everyday people) have the ability to provide that through industry. If we went further to pure capitalism, We could choose for ourselves what to do and how to do it without regulations and restrictions imposed upon us, Designed to keep the poor from competing. For example, I could go out and start building a small customer base and work out of my house until I made enough money to expand. Under the current system (too much government control) I cannot do that, So I would have to be wealthy to gain entry to start up. Taken further (communism, Extreme government control), I could only do what my government tells me I am allowed to do, The limits I'm allowed to produce, The limit I'm allowed to make, And who I'm allowed to sell to, After they take their cut, Of course. The more the market is in control, The less government you have, The more freedom every person in a country has. Everything the government currently does can be provided by the private sector. Imagine how many jobs would be available, And how much freer we would be. This country should take capitalism to the extreme and show the rest of the world how it's don't.",1
12,I hate any kind of dictatorship and everyone should work towards their own wealth. In a capitalist country their will always be new innovations as people will have the motivation to start their own business.

Socialism will quickly collapse, as it always has, the minute the incentive to create and accumulate wealth is removed from society. An elite few will figure out a way to stay on top and then everyone else will slip into a life of poverty and mediocrity.",1
12,"Capitalism believes in ones individual rights of property, labor, and choice in his/hers life, and that the only essential role of government is to protects those individual rights. The fact is that we don't live in a truly capitalist society: FDR has socialized our nation since his introduction of the New Deal, and the closest we ever got to true Capitalism was under Reagan. The economic crises we have had have always happened by government control of the economy, and their failures to micromanage it. Socialism has always failed, from the Kings, Queens, Chiefs, and Emperors in history who claim they have the moral superiority, and make everybody equally poor, to the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea, whom have no rights at all for their people and violate their natural rights because the government has complete authority over one's life and labour.",1

Socialism doesn't account for greed. This is why most socialist governments eventually fail. Greed is a human trait that is ever present.",1

With true socialism, the greed is with the government and the people that want something for nothing.

16,"Yes, protectionism is more efficient then free trade as protectionism ensures a fair market. In a completely free trade market, larger businesses can exploit both their workers and the smaller businesses. This leads to inefficiency as the only way to rectify this is for a smaller business to luck out and become the next big thing, and only if that smaller business is anti-exploitation. A little government oversight sees that this never happens in the first place.",-1
16,"The whole protectionism vs free trade debate all boils down to on who is being affected. If we are talking domestic production, then often protectionism is better then free trade. If we're talking the efficiency of transnational corporations, then free trade is typically more efficient. So it all depends on who is being affected in the end.",-1
16,"Tariffs, quotas, subsidies - all those necessarily lead to deadweight loss. Take tariffs as an example. The price will rise from the world price to a new one, which must lead to a decrease in consumer surplus. their will be an increase in the domestic producer surplus and in government revenue, but their will be two triangles flanking the government revenue which are lost - that is the deadweight loss. Now, whether protectionism is good is another matter and I won't comment on it here.",1
16,Governments should protect the essential goods from threats from foreign competition and instability because without those goods the government will start to lose income. Without income from the taxes from these goods more jobs will dry up because less people are buy into the economy and paying taxes. It is a vicious cycle.,-1
16,"No, governments should not protect essential goods from foreign competition or instability, because governments are inherently bad at manipulating the economy. A government cannot say with certainty that a good is essential. If a good can be purchased cheaply elsewhere, people can save money and spend the money they save on other things. In the end, market forces balance it out. Manipulating the market is inefficient in the long run.",1
16,"I believe the United States should sign and ratify more treaties. This is something that benefits society on a global level and shouldn't been seen as a bad thing. Developing more protectionist policies would essentially close America off to parts of the global world, which hasn't worked for other countries that try it.",1
16,I think the United States should sign more treaties. We need to make sure we have peace with as many countries as possible and seek to help each other rather than be fearful. The more treaties the less war potential their is in the future. Less war is good for everyone.,1

It has raised the standard of living for so many Americans in the 1990s and their continues to be this myth that NAFTA has outsourced jobs to other countries. This is far from the truth. Most of the job loss in America is caused from automation (robots) replacing manual labor, not from free trade between neighboring countries. Free trade, due to the economic concept of comparative advantage, has reduced prices for goods and commodities for Americans. Being anti-free trade will only hurt the American economy and raise prices for most consumer goods and lead to worsening relations with trading partners. Economic isolationism and protectionism (anti free trade) leads to reduced diplomacy between trading partners because each country is committed to reducing their mutual goals for economic growth. Protectionism leads to potential conflict due to trade wars. History repeats itself. Mercantilism doesn't work. The Commercial Revolution led us out of the dark ages. Trump is trying to bring us back into the Dark Ages of excessive trade wars and limited freedom of commerce.",1

17,"What we know about a sustainable society is the balance between environmental exploitation and reservation. Currently, more than 95 percent of products produced in society come from environmental raw materials. Vehicles require fuel taken from the nature, paper industry takes down thousands of trees every to maintain their profits, electricity we use today is the result of burned fossil fuel or nuclear reactions, which are also the product of million-year accumulation. Businesses, industries, and companies can never separate themselves from the environment, the biggest raw material supplier on earth. If people know that production company have to pay for their raw material supplication, then they also know they have to compensate for the environmental exploitation. If companies take down trees, then they have to plant more tree as a return; if they use water from rivers, they have to filter and clean it before they return it back. How can a person lend some money and return it back but cannot reserve the environment from devastation? How can parents teach their children to say ""thank you"" to their good friend but fail to teach them how to show appreciation to the environment? Many companies care so much on their revenues that they forget to show their appreciation to their supplier.",-1

Capitalism, in and of itself, is not so bad, however when businesses become too large they begin to choke out all the competition, which leaves only a handful of people in charge of an entire industry. THAT is a LOT of power, and nobody elected these people to have that much power. I see a lot of people on the ""No"" side that keep saying that we need corporations to provide us with the good we've come to expect. We DO need businesses, but that does not mean that those businesses MUST expand to the size of a multinational corporation. I personally prefer many smaller businesses (which gives the little guy an opportunity to break in to a market) competing with each other then just three or four huge corporations with a stranglehold on the market.

The real problem is that they have become so good at it that they are shifting the balance of wealth so much as to cause economic instability. Billions is spent to shift the opinions of the public and government law makers so that corporations can make more money. If a balance were achieved so that the population as a whole and corporations (and the rich) increased in wealth at the same rate, the economy would improve at an unprecedented rate. The general populations should have the mindset that as technology improves and corporations are able to make more profits, so should employees. Without increased regulations and general shift of public mindset, the future will be full of very poor and very overworked people (and a few very very rich corporations). Perhaps evil might not be the best term as they are not people themselves, but they have a very real potential to cause unimaginable pain and suffering in the quality of life of all persons in the future (if current trends continue).",-1

I know people are going to think that this example is way over the top and I am certainly not suggesting that corporations ruthlessly murder innocent people but the PREMISE of the argument remains. It is true that corporations aren't inherently evil. However, if we are able to judge them by a standard that claims they are not evil then we must judge them by the opposite standard: They aren't inherently good either. Good and evil are human interpretations of morality which, most would agree, are based on the common standards of right and wrong and the assumption that being human grants us this knowledge inherently. Perhaps we assume too much. Since we can't judge a faceless company by the same standards we judge human beings (although we still punish individuals for violation of ""widely accepted perceptions"" regarding morality even if the individual does not inherently experience the emotions required to guide moral judgement) we must then judge it based on it's motives. The Red Cross, for example, in most instances, can be deemed ""good"" because it's goal is to help the helpless, a goal which would be noble for a human as well. Walmart has a track record littered with destruction of small ""family-owned"" competitors and sweat-shop merchandise which must be judged by the overall impact it's actions have had on humanity as well. Judging by our standards of human morality would you consider an individual guided solely by the accumulation of wealth to be good? You do the math!",-1

Lots of anti corporate paranoia comes from the idea that a person can more easily control a government then a corporation.

No of these things a corporation has the power to do. Of course, the place for state industry is for welfare, in situations were people can't afford to pay what a product is actually worth. This is fine, but the fear of corporations in other circumstances that has lead to the benefit of the doubt being given to our government in economic issues is misplaced.

The people who hate corporations are the people who don't understand that doing the right thing is usually far more profitable then doing the wrong thing. The truth is that from an early age we are bombarded with anti-corporation propaganda designed to give us an unrealistic view of corporations as evil greedy monsters. Envy is far more destructive than greed. We like to think of them as powerful things that we can blame all of the worlds problems on and thereby lift the blame off ourselves. The truth is that workers are blaming corporations for their own inefficiency; as technology improves the need for physical workers drops. The truth is that the average corporation is actually more law abiding then the average US citizen. Are employees really any less greedy then their bosses? The truth is that if corporations didn't maximize profit they would have less to pay their increasingly obsolete workers; they would have less to invest in innovation and would be quickly be out-competed and go out of business, assuring that everyone who depended on it would starve. The reason we hate them so much is that we depend on them, they are the producers of the economic ecosystem, we merely say they're evil to justify putting ourselves above the whole truth.",1

Corporations will always be perceived as evil and unscrupulous, but in reality, the majority of them are operated by good, moral people and are not hell-bent on screwing people over.

17,"their is an answer to capitalism. Look at the Mondragon cooperatives in Spain which is united by a humanist concept of business, a philosophy of participation and solidarity, and a shared business culture. The culture is rooted in a shared mission and a number of principles, corporate values and business policies. Over the years, these links have been embodied in a series of operating rules approved on a majority basis. This framework of business culture has been structured based on a common culture derived from the Basic Co-operative Principles, in which Mondragon is rooted: Open Admission, Democratic Organization, the Sovereignty of Labor, Instrumental and Subordinate Nature of Capital, Participatory Management, Payment Solidarity, Inter-cooperation, Social Transformation, Universality and Education. This philosophy is complemented by four Corporate Values: Co-operation, acting as owners and protagonists; Participation, which takes shape as a commitment to management; Social Responsibility, by means of the distribution of wealth based on solidarity; and Innovation, focusing on constant renewal in all areas.[17] This business culture translates into compliance with a number of Basic Objectives (Customer Focus, Development, Innovation, Profitability, People in Cooperation and Involvement in the Community) and General Policies approved by the Co-operative Congress, which are taken on board at all the Corporation’s organisational levels and incorporated into the four-year strategic plans and the annual business plans of the individual co-operatives, Divisions, and the Corporation as a whole.[18] Wage regulation At Mondragon, their are agreed-upon wage ratios between executive work and field or factory work which earns a minimum wage. These ratios range from 3:1 to 9:1 in different cooperatives and average 5:1. That is, the general manager of an average Mondragon cooperative earns 5 times as much as the theoretical minimum wage paid in his/her cooperative. In reality, this ratio is smaller because their are few Mondragon worker-owners that earn minimum wages, because most jobs are somewhat specialized and so are classified at higher wage levels. The wage ratio of a cooperative is decided periodically by it's worker-owners through a democratic vote.[19] Compared to similar jobs at local industries, Mondragon wages are 30% or less at management levels[clarification needed] and equivalent for middle management, technical and professional levels. Lower wage levels are on average 13% higher than similar jobs at local businesses. Spain's progressive tax rate further reduces any disparity in pay.[19]",-1

But that is precisely what redistribution is: theft. Right to property, right to liberty, and right to life are all that needed for the framework of a prosperous society. Capitalist societies are by far the most wealthy and fastest growing of all countries in the world. Also, countries that liberalize their economies (IE. Make them ""freer"") see faster GDP growth rates. This added wealth creates numerous jobs, increases in standards of living, and overall more prosperous and healthy lives. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have societies ranging from the Soviet Union to the North Korean dictatorship.

Taking more wealth from ""the rich"" will increase the prices of products and services, increase unemployment, decrease employee salaries, and decrease charitable donations.

Today we are so careful about what you can say without it being against equality, But when it comes to getting the state more money, there’s no problems at all. According to the tax policy center, The top 1 percent of people in the from of income tax stood for more than 40% of the federal tax income in the us alone. Responsibility - We all make a choice in life of what we want to be. Someone maybe wants to become a politician or a wealthy business owner while the other might want to become a bus driver or work in a factory. their is a significant difference in the income, But the person in question really doesn't have a say in whether the income should be high or not, And so why should someone be forced to pay more money because they have a higher income that they didn't decide The Government already waste much of the tax that they collect. If they decide to increase the tax for the rich then it's more likely that they are wasting jus more of it The question of the tax amount is already ongoing in the regular society, About how they shouldn't need to pay for something they don't need. Eg. Why should the 70 year old woman who lives at home alone have to pay tax for her revenue of selling newspapers when she doesn't use any services at all, Except for that one visit to the doctor costing maybe 500? Raising taxes might even worsen the country’s economy as the larger companies might opt out from operating in the country due to the high taxes. If the company in question has a high turnout-revenue, The country would lose potentially millions, Just for being greedy in taxes. This is an example of why many of the online casinos, Aircrafts and vessels of the world rather operate or wear the flag of malta, Monaco or panama instead of the U. S, Sweden or britain, Or how wealthy people store their wealth in swiss accounts. The higher taxes would possibly also lead to large unemployment due to the companies that chose another country with lower taxes to operate from. And with more unemployed people, there’s more money that’ll need to support the unemployed. Together with this, One less company spending money in the country is always equal to less income of sales-tax.",1

And where did the funding for this equal opportunity Educational system come from? FROM TAXING THE RICH INITIALLY. By no means am i saying the system is perfect, but it works to an extent; it gives everyone at least a chance to do as best as they can; so will increasing taxation at the top end really change the situation? it's widely believed that a better education= better job.

We need to raise taxes on most/many Americans after the economy picks back up. A common response to raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans is ""Why do you think it is okay to tax someone more just because they have been successful?"" This is very misleading. First, most wealthy Americans are able to take advantage of certain tax breaks that are not available to the middle class. Second, and perhaps one of the most important points, the super-wealthy as a group keep a huge amount of money locked away in nontaxable offshore accounts.

That’s only a third of this year’s deficit. Our national debt would continue to explode. Also, even if you could balance the budget by taxing the rich, it would not be right. Progressives say it’s wrong for the rich to be “given” more money. The New York Times ran a cartoon that showed Uncle Sam handing money to a fat cat. But that has it backward. Money earned belongs to those who earn it, not to government. Lower taxes are not a handout. Progressives want to take more money from some—by force—and spend much of it on programs that have repeatedly failed. It sounds less noble when plainly stated. That’s the moral side of the matter. there’s a practical side, too. Taxes discourage wealth creation. If the government takes up to 90% of my income, which at one time it did, why should I work harder to create wealth, jobs, income for others, if the government is going to take most, if not all my money. I will work less, for less, not hire people, not create income streams for me and others and keep more of my money. Progressives claim an increase in tax rates won’t stop producers from producing. But they presumably understand that people don't work for free. When the top marginal rate was 90 percent, actor Ronald Reagan worked just half the year. As soon as he made enough money such that every additional dollar was taxed at 90 percent, he stopped working and went off to ride horses. Reagan later said that woke him up to the damage that high taxes impose. Also, higher taxes give rich people and politicians more reasons to collude. The rich make contributions to political campaigns, and politicians pay the rich back by giving them tax loopholes. The loopholes complicate the tax code and create work for tax specialists like accountants. Accountants are paid because people often cannot begin to figure out their taxes. Why give your money to an accountant. Our loophole-ridden tax system is now so complex that today there are many Americans paying an accountant.",1

How is it fair to tax some people more then others because they were smart and (for lack of a better phrase) took advantage of our capitalist economy? Every person, rich or poor, has the same opportunity to achieve success in the capitalist economy, so why should rich have more obstacles to keep the riches that they made? It isn't fair that the person who makes 300,000 dollars a year gets taxed almost 150,000 dollars from both state and federal, while the person who makes 50000 dollars is only taxed a total of 13000. Half is not equal to about a quarter.",1
18,"I don't think this is the right move. it's an easy move, and it's easy to see why it appeals to a lot of people. However, naturally, if the rich deserved to be rich, they should keep their money. I think we can all agree to that. So why do so many people think they should pay extra? I would hypothesize that it is because people feel that somehow the rich have been assisted in their ascension by the system. it's not necessarily their fault (though sometimes the exploitation IS blatant), but they should essentially pay for the system's help, and the benefits it confers once wealth is obtained. The trouble with taxing the rich is then obvious. it's not addressing the real culprit: the discrepancies in the system. In order to fix the system, we should devise an ideal model that incentivizes the appropriate economic behaviors and otherwise treats everyone fairly and equally, then apply only the changes which bring our current model closer to the ideal. Taxation of the rich fails to incentivize productivity and personal responsibility and also fails to treat everyone equally. Therefore, it's not a good solution. One interesting change I might propose for discussion is, upon a person's death, absorbing all acquired properties and wealth of the deceased into the state funds for re-appropriation. This solves the perceived unfairness of the rich being ""born into"" wealth. It evens the playing field a little more between rich children and poor children. It provides the government with more liquid assets to solve problems. Naturally it would need fine tuning, but I think it's a very interesting proposal that addresses several major roadblocks.

This is not true, the poor are mostly the working poor, who work several jobs, much harder than the rich people. Research it - ""working poor"" More personal income = More personal benefit. This is false unless you think that a wide screen LCD is the be and end all of your life, personal income cannot really buy anything except widgets and toys. The more important things in life, ie. safety, job security, affordable accommodations, food quality, pollution free energy, telecommunications, family, health, infrastructure (trains, buses etc.), are best regulated and controlled by a centralized government. Good luck trying to buy your own plane and train with less taxes. Profit orientation = Social good. This is false; the design of profit-oriented corporations will inevitably place profit as priority and above environmental protection, equitable pay, national interests, ethical business practices, and sometimes legal restraints. It doesn't matter how ethical or good-willed the employees are, if the corporation is designed that way to achieve 20% profit growth every year, it inevitably happens. Money for Taxes = Disappears in a black hole. This is false, taxes are spent on an agenda, and are an investment in society. Such an investment would be early childhood development, a better train infrastructure, improvements in minority education, etc etc. Almost all of the complaints made the RH column; complaints about ""lazy"" people, corporations moving overseas, business inhibition. All of these things may be assisted with government spending on systems and policies. To assist with this, mandate re-education and training for lazy people, government assistance for locally based entrepreneurship, and departments to streamline business regulation. If you paid less taxes, are you going to personally donate your money to assist business in doing something specific, or re-educate a ""lazy"" person?

He feels no responsibility for the fact that tax loopholes both personal and corporate have at least in part contributed to the desolation of our economy. The ruthless, money grabbing liquidation of the very wealth-building manufacturing that built America in the first place has completed the process. As for tomorrow?

Also a fair rate for the rich should be higher because a middle class person paying a 14% takes far more of their money then a wealthy person making more then lets say 250,000 dollars a year. Another thing is that the rich don't spend all the money they make and so it doesn't end up stimulating the economy, where as if the middle class has a lower tax then they are able to spend more because they have to which stimulates the economy and helps everyone in the long run.

In my opinion balance is the key. If a product or service is in high demand and has a high value and business owners are able to fluctuate the prices according to the market then the pay for the employees working under their businesses should be fluctuated as well accordingly. it's not fair that a business can cut cost by laying people off and have the workers left over picking up the slack. A position in a job should be specific in terms of what is expected from an employee and if cuts have to be made a raise should be granted to the worker who is being assigned more work because he/she is working two jobs now.

18,"During the 50's and 60's, the top tax brackets ranged from 70% to 90%. This coincided with the economic high point of the United States. During the 1980's with Reagan's tax cuts, and during the 2000's with the Bush tax cuts, Job creation declined, and income inequality increased considerably. In fact, During the 2000's, the Average income of the American people decreased, not increased. Therefore, one concludes that the tax breaks did not benefit the United States and its citizens. In earlier times, the wealthy paid their share, seeing it as their duty. In the present, the wealthy argue that the fact they own a business and have employees (which benefits them primarily) exempts them from paying a higher percentage or even an equal percentage of income as the middle and working class. The ""Job Creator"" title is a myth merely to mask greed. They are not doing it to benefit the USA, merely their own pocketbooks. These people will harm the USA by outsourcing jobs and firing all employees if it gets them enough cash for another jet and another Ferrari. Another point to make is that education and infrastructure are funded by tax dollars. Wealthy business owners and corporations benefit most from these. A degree will benefit one's employer more then the his/her self. Infrastructure facilitates commerce, which is the lifeblood of any company. Since the wealthy derive more of a benefit education and infrastructure, it is their duty to pay taxes to ensure an exemplary school and university system and good infrastructure. A better trained workforce and the ability to move goods more efficiently would increase revenue for the wealthy and for businesses. They would also reap the rewards from paying taxes. Thomas Jefferson warned about allowing the monied interests control of our country. We cannot allow the wealthy, business owners and corporation to dictate our tax policy, let alone our labor laws or product safety standards. They require structure and regulation. The founding fathers wrote on this subject. They were very much against big corporations (even Alexander Hamilton). To finish up, a lower tax rate on the wealthy does not and will not mean more high paying jobs in the United States. The vast majority of citizens don't derive a benefit from lower taxes. The wealthy use failed logic and bad arguments to mask their true reason for not wanting to pay taxes, which is greed. Businesses have created few jobs, and shipped high paying work overseas to increase their already record corporate profits. Low paying work is what remains. Profits for corporations are at an all time high, and the stock market is at record high levels in 2012. The little guy (small business and the working people) is still suffering. One can only conclude that low taxes on the wealthy don't work for our citizens and that the rich need to pay taxes at rates closer to the ones in the 1950's.",-1

18,"Of course the wealthy should pay more than the rest of us! It is simple numbers. Firstly, people like to say that the wealthy already pay the majority of the income taxes. However, when the top 10% of the country owns around 80% of the wealthy, it's to be expected that they will carry the Federal Income tax. Secondly, people like to say that the wealthy get taxed twice (once at the income level, and once at the corporate level). But, our income tax levels on the wealthy are only around 10-15%, and even though Corporate taxes are 35% the effective corporate (meaning the actual tax rate of large businesses) is only around 10%. Thirdly, let's be clear on this. Someone making 1,000,000 dollars, who is taxed up to 60% (EFFECTIVE corporate and income taxes) still comes home with 400,000 to live off of. Taxing someone 25% on 50,000, leaves that person with 37,500 to live off of. If you still think that it's fair, then you are either stupid, or wealthy yourself (and therefor greedy). Also, shame on the people who accuse the poor for not working hard, or for saying that hard work will make you rich. If that were true, then the Mexican immigrants to this country would be millionaires. Some of the wealthiest people in this country got that way by inheriting from their father's who lied, cheated, and stole their money, and made it on the backs of hard-working people.",-1
18,"The rich claim to be successful due to ""hard work."" Now, I don't doubt that their are at least some rich people who have rightfully earned their way to the top, but money generally flows from one end to another: most money of the rich is taken from the lower classes. I think rich people try to justify their ""success"" by claiming they worked hard for it. In truth, the rich, (ESPECIALLY the super-rich) earn their money by charging ridiculously high prices for a good or service (such as gas). And what do rich people even need their excess money for, anyway? If they have more than enough to live comfortably, they should use the rest to fund schools and healthcare--things that actually matter. Money isn't meant to just sit their and accumulate. It has to circulate. That's the way the economy is supposed to work.",-1

Also some people might be rich because they saved money to become a millionaire. They also have a more stable income as i read in the opinion section (Knights The8). Yes i would expect them to have a stable income unless they have their business is failing.

People with a lot of money can afford to do or have things they don't need. For example, nobody ‘needs’ four or five enormous houses. They might not even use all of the houses; it’s just an extra thing to worry about. Plus, that money could have gone to a better cause. Also, the poor need their money to survive. Unlike the rich who have a superabundance of money, the poor use all of their money for food and shelter. In addition, the poor don't want to have to worry about tax.

Now, for someone making 20M, these were really big cuts so instead of deferring income (slowing the economy) the rich could get richer without paying as many taxes. Worked great, in 1986 when the rich had astronomical tax rates. FLASH FORWARD to 2012. The top income tax rate is 28% and the long term capital gains is at an all time low of 15%. This was don't by George W Bush to try and emulate the stimulus that occurred in Reagan years. Didn't work, can't work. The rich already get to keep most of their money (if not all when using tax loopholes). Today, with the rich holding so much cash, it is more profitable to be a corporate raider then it is to actually employ people and build things. Let's take the tax rates back to the Reagan tax rates. Let's add deductions for the rich who actually employ people and build things.",-1
18,"it's not enough, what we're paying right now. Everyone should do their part. I'm sick of these stereotypes, that we're poor only because we ""choose not to work and that we're lazy"". Some of us are just poor. Our jobs don't pay enough. We can't live on minimum wage. We need food stamps and Medicare and such to help us get by. Yet we still pay taxes to do our part. The well-off and the rich have almost more money than they know what to do with, and rather then giving a significant amount of it to charity, they splurge on useless gadgets and luxuries that they really can do without. Don't you think that the money would be better off used to help pay taxes? it's also true that many of the rich have gained their wealth through dishonest and illegal means. A lot of them don't even work full-time jobs. So don't call us lazy. ""Hard work pays""?! You must be joking. Don't you dare say that we're not hard-working. Some of us work more than a full day at a time. More than eight hours, and we still can't get by. Because the rich keep getting richer, and the poor keep getting poorer. Others on the opposing side argue that everyone should be treated equally. Are the poor being treated equal to the rich? No. The help that we from taxes are so that we can even survive in this failing economy. Imagine this: A poor man pays 10% of their $20,000 annual income. The rich pays 10% of their $200,000 annual income. That's $2,000 and $20,000, respectively. Although it's a $18,000 difference, the rich man still has $180,000. then poor man has a measly $18,000. That's not including deductions from utility bills, rent, and whatnot. The rich man will have way more than enough left over that he will spend on luxuries and useless things rather than donating some to charity to help a specific group, or to help the economy that he lives in by paying higher taxes. it's not as if he's being asked to give all that he has left to taxes. And even if he were asked to give in an extra 10%, he would still have a lot more then he knew what to do with. it's not the same for the poor. Why can't you see it?",-1

I am tired of hearing the same, tired rhetoric from the right about, “I worked for it and I deserve it!” Do you? How honest were you while “earning” this money? How many people believe they were paid enough by you? Why can't you pay them more? Oh, because you are being taxed to death! Boohoo! First, YOU did not work for what you have, someone else did, your employees! You owe it to them while you are sitting on your yacht not caring about whether you people are paid enough. You have never had to work a poor paying job where your boss is a tool. Ask yourself this question, “How much money is enough money?” Who on this earth truly NEEDS to be a millionaire? Who needs 10 expensive cars and a massive house? That does not mean you are successful! Ask yourself whether or not you treat other people well. Can you look in the mirror and ask that question? Like it or not, no one is an island. So, pay people well, treat them well and we on the left will not fight you for more money with the IRS. Deal?

The wealthiest 1 percent of this country now has more money then the bottom 150 million people and wealth inequality is at an all time high in this country. This cannot go on forever and the government should seek to moderate some of this disparity through higher taxes on the rich which are conducive to economic growth. For example in the 1950s the top rate on taxpayers was 91% and the economy grew at 4% annual rate. Compare this to the 1980's when the economy grew at a 2.5% annual rate and the upper tax bracket was 28%.,-1

If you don't think the rich should pay more tax then get used to living under an elite oligarchic society. The founding fathers would not approve of the excessively generous tax cuts given to the us wealthy classes since Reagan first went down this path on the premise of ""trickle down economics."" Well you should be starting to notice exactly how much has trickled up from the poor and the middle towards the top by now.

18,"The real question should be, ""should all United States citizens be required to pay higher taxes on the portion of their income that falls in the highest tax brackets."" Everyone in America, from the poverty-stricken to billionaires, pays the exact same tax rate (assuming married filing jointly) -- approximately 10% on the first $18,000, 15% between $18,000 and $70,000, 25% between $70,000 and $142,000 and so on up to 35% over $388,000. The idea behind taxing the top brackets more is for two reasons: 1) People with incomes in those top brackets tend to use that money for things like savings, vacations, purchases, etc., thereby increasing their use and need of infrastructure like roads and bridges and services such as firemen, policemen, etc., and 2) The more money people have, the less value it has for them (the economic idea of ""diminishing marginal value""): once a person's physical needs are well-met, additional money is worth less to them, so a homeless recipient of a $20 bill will see more value in it then a billionaire would with a $100 gift.

The interstates and airports and FAA and TSA benefit people who have the money to travel. Here's another good reason for the rich to pay more taxes: With the drop in tax revenue, funding for the preservation of American culture is disappearing. Do we want our national treasures deprived of maintenance because of budget cuts, as is currently happening in Italy? Do we want our national parks sold to billionaires? Do we want programs for music and the arts eliminated from schools, so that only children of the wealthy can participate in them?",-1
18,"They make their money because of the wonderful infrastructure they have access to. They reap significant benefits of this through access to a strong population of well educated or skilled workers, and a good infrastructure for these people to get to their workplaces. This infrastructure requires money to function and grow, and since the rich can scale their wealth against this, it would only make sense for them to pay a larger percentage of their income toward taxes. I take this from personal experience, earning enough to be well within the top 1%. I have a good business because I have a strong team of intelligent and hard working employees that are incredibly productive. They are all products of a subsidized education system and have a much stronger base set of knowledge and skill sets when compared to their equivalents in other countries (where I also have businesses and experience). This allows me to provide a substantial level of service, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Like many rich people, I am ambitious, and with ambition like mine, comes a certain level of greed. I do what I do so I can make more money. I know I can charge an enormous sum of money to my clients who will gladly pay seven figures for my services. I know I can pay my hard working employees a fraction of what they are really worth, because that is the market for it, and because their isn't really enough competition to warrant an increase in salaries. I know I can pay all of my employees significantly more, but that it would also mean I would take home significantly less. The other people like me, rich business owners, all think like me - we're all wired the same way, that is, to generate more revenue, and put more money into our bank account. After all, that is what led us to become entrepreneurs in the first place. If you tax me more, I may say that it will mean I have less money left to hire more employees - that is only true because in order to keep my luxurious lifestyle, I would rather reduce my expenses, cut my workforce, and simply make the existing employees work harder vs having less money for myself. I will never say that I want to be taxed higher, but if you do, I will still manage, I will have to accept having less money in my pocket, but I will still be fine - and in fact, my business will still probably continue to grow, so long as the need for my services exists and I can continue to hire skilled and educated workers - I can continue to scale, even if the dollar signs don't quite add up as quickly as they would have had I been taxed less. A flat tax is not the solution. The middle income mother filling the tank on her minivan will always be under a greater burden than me filling the tank on my Porsche. The extra money I have will go to help grow the economy in China. The tiles and flooring that I bought when I remodeled my house came from China, the care that I bought was manufactured in Germany, and only the labor to install those goods or sell me the care came from the states, and that is just a fraction of the total expenditure. I cannot even find goods that are made in the United States to put my money back into because almost EVERYTHING is made outside of this country (except maybe my gf's LV bag that is miraculously made in the United States). When I read some of the comments on the right, I begin to understand the reasons behind why people like me don't want to pay more...because we feel entitled, because we ""figured it out"" on our own while everyone else is just getting by, because we feel ""special"" and it is further reinforced by my house in hills, my resort like gym, my big corner window office. And that is just where the problem is - see, if any of my employees told me that I should pay more in taxes because I make ""more than enough"" it would only anger me, because from my perspective, they ""just don't get it."" They didn't put in what I did to get where I am only to throw it all back in taxes. But when my rich business partner says the exact same thing - I actually think about it and agree, because my sense of entitlement disappears when talking to people within my same tax bracket, allowing me to approach the topic with clearer thought. So what we really need is more rich people telling other rich people to ""Give back."" But the real kick in the nuts - the government is going to take my tax revenue and spend it in ways I don't agree with or have a say in. They're going to pass shit like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and every effort I make to prevent them from doing this, will be thwarted.",-1

However, for the rich people such as the doctor who complains about going to school for so long and working hard to get to where he is, that's a fair argument, but just because he is blessed by the good lord with intelligence to be a doctor and do a job that commands a higher pay that he should live a better life then say someone that is mentally retarded? I think not. Things do need to be fair. The two biggest problems is the government wasting money, allowing too many loopholes in taxes so that rich actually pay a smaller percentage in taxes then people who make less, people who simply refuse to work and live off of the government.

18,"The rich aren't smarter, wiser, or harder working then the poor. That doesn't mean that they shouldn't get any sort of reward for their success, but simply that wealth alone should be its own reward. Simply speaking, the primary ways people become rich involve mostly luck, and may or may not have anything to do with hard work. Typically, they come from upper middle class to wealthy families that can pay for college without saddling them with a crushing debt that would make it impossible to invest their money properly after college, who can offer them positions in their company, and sometimes offer them the company themselves. They are the people who grew up interacting with the rich and their families, developed connections that helped them financially, and put them in the position they needed to be in to succeed. I am not saying they should be penalized for this, however, merely that being rich should be its own reward. Even if the rich were taxed a higher percentage then some guy making $12,000 a year, they would still be far richer than that guy, and still make far more than they could ever possibly spend. Furthermore, taxes are not a punishment. Taxes are you paying your part into society so that society continues to function, so why shouldn't those who society has given so much to give a little more than someone who society has left hungry and financially devastated? I make $1,200 a month. Every week in taxes, I pay one day's wages in taxes. At the end of the year, I usually get about $37 back. The working poor pay this all the time with so little complaint that the rich aren't even aware that they're paying it, so my question is why should a person making more than a million dollars, even more then $250,000, yelp and whimper over every dollar they are asked to pay to keep our roads paid, to pay for our military, our fire department, our police. And when you ask why the poor can't pay as much in sheer dollars as you, then I say you only deserve the police, roads, and fire department that the poor can afford. More money goes into these services then goes into programs for the poor, and these services are often quicker and more thorough in helping the wealthy then the poor. If wealthy are going to use loopholes to get out of paying taxes, and whine over every tax they're left with, then I say let them, but when their house burns, the fire department should let it burn, and if their house is broken into, they should be the only one who defends it. I don't think the rich should be punished for being rich by any means, but I do think that they shouldn't whine over every penny paid to government, or 'lobby' money at congress to keep their taxes down, if they want to reap the benefits of living in a society that has served them so well.",-1
18,"With inequality of wealth comes civil unrest. Here's a little history for you. If you look back to the 1930's, President Roosevelt understood the rich had to pay more or something far worse would be coming from the people....a real SOCIALIST MOVEMENT that would change our way of governance. there was a highly organized, highly popular with the population, and a very vocal socialist movement To quiet the uprising Roosevelt convinced enough of the wealthy to pay much more. They agreed to pay an astonishing 94% on all earnings beyond what would be an equivalent of $350,000 today. Social Security and Medicare came in play too. When workers have a stake and say in the company for which they work they always make sure the profits are shared, unlike now, when just a few own the majority of shares in a company. Today they tend to give the lion's share of the profit to the CEOs at grossly amounts. We have enough money in our country to pay for and balance our financial woes. It is called taxing the wealthy and corporations. The wealthy need to step up and do their civic responsibility to the greater society needs of America. America is always strongest and healthiest financially, when the middle class is stronger. This pulls more of the poor up to the middle class. The arrogance of wealthy to say the poor and middle class are just lazy is such an lie and insult. I think we should tax at least 90% on all income beyond $350,000.

And please don't tell me it's going to help the poor. In America, you are considered poor if you can't afford television. The American poor usually have things like refrigerators and telephones. And that's considered poor!",-1
18,"True that if you work hard you can earn more. However, their is a difference between hard work earnings and using every tax deduction possible to pay annual taxes of 1.6 million and it only being 17.5% of your income.

Let's end the extremes of poverty and wealth and create a better country!",-1

Their also never held accountable for their illegal money laundering and tax free money and then we want to cut them a tax break on top of allowing their corruption.,-1
18,"I believe it is right to tax the people who make more money. If I were a person who would make a million a year I surely wouldn't mind paying extra to help out locals and our state. If someone who makes a million a year and pays lets say a rate of 10.55%, they would be paying about $105,500 a year which would give them $894,500 a year. I would definitely love to be making that much per year. Even 600k a year or even 300k per year! So, I believe that if everyone would just become a little more considerate, everyone would be able to be happier and others would be in less poverty. Someone who has the ability to make that much, should be able to have no problem making that money back, right???",-1

18,"The natural resources are limited. It might be true to say that the rich make their own way to be rich but most of them based on exploitation on others. The rich complain on taxes but they don't realize that the taxes are to pay for what they have took away. The foods they eat, the drinks they swallow are much more expensive they paid expensive parties with politicians. They kill people by putting poison in food and drink legally. They rob people's money by promising profit, then they took all the profit. They use tax money to give bonus to top manager while the company almost bankrupt. Who lost if the companies go bankrupt? The poor, the investors, the workers. The rich put money on their own pockets and ran away. So you think you make your own way to be rich? If only you earn it yourselves using your ability and your resources. You exploit other, you capture natural resources, you make laws and control the people using media. And you think you can get away with it? Think about Roman Empire and learn your lesson.",-1
18,"Does the slave not work harder than his master? No says the willfully ignorant American white man. Capitalist systems reward corruption and predatory behavior by people, while punishing those who are not born to rich parents. Government has a responsibility to even the playing field by increasing opportunities for the poor, and this requires funds for health care and education. The rich profit from the labor of the poor, so they must give back what rightfully belongs to the people. The truth is, the higher up in management you make it in a corporation, the less actual work you do per dollar you earn. The laborers at Foxconn in China work harder than the CEO of Apple, yet they make a tiny wage while Apple reaps hundreds of billions in profits that are not being used to the benefit of the general population. When wealth is concentrated in the hands of such a small percent of the population, economic growth is impossible because markets are driven by demand, and there is no demand for common goods when a majority of the population has very little wealth. their is a clear correlation with inequality and economic growth.",-1
18,"I think to a certain extent that they should, but it also depends on how rich we're talking. Say 500,000 annual salary vs 10 billion. Anything over a million should be taxed more, the president doesn't even make a million a year. What is someone doing that is so magnificent that deserves over a million every year....And the people making billions a year at the expense of others don't even get me started. In the United States 1% of the population owns over 90% of the wealth. Really, 60% tax on a billion dollar salary isn't really going to break the bank. If someone can't live on 400 million a year somethings wrong.",-1
18,"They should at least pay an equal percentage of their worth as the working people of this nation. People seem to forget that even when the wealthiest Americans paid tax rates upwards of 90% (during, by the way, what were some of the most prosperous times in American history for the highest percentage of Americans ever) they still managed to live extravagant life styles and accumulate wealth beyond most Americans wildest dreams. The revenue created could be used to cut the cost of things such as health care, groceries, transportation and education (in theory anyhow, in reality the greed mongers usually just use the increased revenues to raise their bottom line and give rich people more money), things that hard working Americans stress over and lose sleep about every day. Furthermore, if the wealthiest Americans carried their fare share of the burden in other ways, such as providing a LIVING wage instead of a ""minimum wage"" (after all, if you've been convinced that lowering a corporations annual profits from 5.7 billion to 3.4 billion dollars is going to bankrupt them, then you're either naive or ignorant. You should give them a lesson on how a family of 5 can balance a budget on 20,000 grand a year!) and by keeping American jobs in America the ENTIRE nation, as a whole, as a community. As the great UNION it's supposed to be would be stronger and more prosperous. After all, what's the point in accumulating great wealth just to watch your brothers and sisters starve and freeze?",-1
18,"Balance is the key! It is true that people of wealth have a found a way to reach their current income level and it is hard work in terms of research and figuring out tactics that work for the industries they run, but they are not the ones doing the back breaking work or working long hours on their feet for minimum pay. In my opinion balance is the key. If a product or service is in high demand and has a high value and business owners are able to fluctuate the prices according to the market then the pay for the employees working under their businesses should be fluctuated as well accordingly. it's not fair that a business can cut cost by laying people off and have the workers left over picking up the slack. A position in a job should be specific in terms of what is expected from an employee and if cuts have to be made a raise should be granted to the worker who is being assigned more work because he/she is working two jobs now. This is where the argument of laziness comes into place. it's not that the people want to be lazy it's the simple fact that people are tired of having to settle for less. ""it's a problem of motivation, all right? Now if I work my butt off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime, so where's the motivation?"" (quoted from Office Space 1999). I'm sure many people can relate to the line in this movie whether you have seen it or not. If Business X sales are up employees don't benefit from it but if the sales decrease then employees have to bite the dust. it's sad to see that a piece of paper has more value than a human being in this time of age. Do you call that progress? Being that the system is not set up that way and a business has that advantage I do feel that rich people should have to pick up the economy's slack because they had us doing so when ""times were hard"" in their business.",-1

Great start! Not going to be nearly enough. Bake sale? I tried it! Still didn't raise enough moolah. Tax the poor? Generates a couple pennies. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think democrats are going to let us cut a ridiculous amount of programs to the point where we're actually going to be able to start lowing the debt. Right now the tax rate for the 1% is about 15% on most of their income , plus the 35% on that small amount that they get from their actual salary. I don't think we should go back to the 40s where the tax rate for the 1% would be 90%, but I think we can find some sort of middle ground? What do you say?",-1

For the 1% who hold the most money in the United States, they pay less taxes then most middle class families, because of the various loopholes that they take the time to look for in the Taxation laws, wherever they can be found.",-1
18,"Plain and simple, if you make more then you should pay more. Not to break the backs of the wealthy, but they owe some of their wealth to living in this country. After all, they do use the resources and they sell goods and services here. Think about it, if there was a flat tax for most earners of 10% (their would have to be another lower bracket for those who earn 40,000 or less), then a person making a hundred thousand would pay ten thousand and a person making a million would pay a 100,000. Proportionally, it works out to be more taxes if you happen to be richer, but you still have lots leftover compared to a lesser earning individual. Gone are the loopholes and tax breaks. But wait, you say this sounds way too fair! If I made 30 million, I have to pay 3 million and only keep 27 million..... But I could have started a new company and hired workers..... Yeah, right you will! At least that 3 million will turn into better schools, better roads, better medical research, etc. I think we'd all be winners, but some people think fair is unfair.

Many middle-class taxpayers work hard to provide for their families and to keep themselves out of debt. It don't make any sense to take more money from families with less income when you have the rich that has everything they could want and need and plus more money. In my opinion, this is one reason why the economy is falling apart, there are too many people that are stingy with their money and as long as everything is going good for them, they don't care about anyone else.

A flat tax is unfair, because although the percentage of income is equal, the utility of each increment of income is not. Simple economics. Think of it this way. If you have 100 dollars and it's taxed at 10 percent, and your neighbor has 1,000 dollars and that is taxed at 10 percent, the flat rate seems fair. But it is quite obvious when you deal with real dollars and cents that the more money you have, the less each individual dollar is worth to you. Percentages aside, that ten dollars will hurt your wallet far more than your neighbors 100 dollars. A progressive tax takes money based on utility rather than raw numbers, and that is the type of tax that is fairest and makes the most sense.",-1

The total expenditure per capita was $2,141. China had the second largest military expenditure of all the countries in 2012. The total expenditure per capita for them was $74. With that being said, why do you think we have such a large military? What are we protecting? Our land? Our ""freedom""? We are protecting our wealth. Our top 1% represents the bull's eye to the target that has been painted on America by other countries. They should be the ones paying to defend it. They say that the amount of money it takes to protect a fortune exponentially increases when compared to the amount of the fortune itself. To me, that sounds like excellent framework to begin building the tax bracket on. But paying their taxes in the first place would absolutely be a good start.",-1

We barely make enough money to live on, let alone pay a ridiculous amount of taxes every year. We have bills to pay and children to feed. What do the rich have? A multi-million dollar house to pay off? A swimming pool as big as a football field to install in their backyard? Maybe that's an exaggeration, but that's how I see it. The rich don't understand need vs want, because they can buy whatever they want and already have everything they need. They don't know what it's like for their children to come home from school and go to bed hungry because there's no food in the house. They don't know what it's like to go without a shower because the water company cut you off when you had to use your pay check to buy food for your kids instead of pay the bill.

Regardless of where you came from, you have either been given great chances or have come into great circumstances. You have been given a chance, and like it or not, it is not entirely your own doing. Your family, your friends, your community, your environment have all shaped who you are, the chances you've been given, and how you responded to them. It seems to me that paying higher taxes is an acceptable and beneficial way of repaying a debt that society has provided to you, at very little true detriment to yourself. If you choose to think that you have made your own fortune, all on your lonesome, then that is your viewpoint. Perhaps you should consider that it may be a limited one, because no one becomes who they are entirely on their own.",-1

Also, taxing the rich higher is an absolute economic necessity. Yes, we tax people in order to pay for nice things like roads and schools. We also tax people to stabilize the economy.

18,"I think a 80% tax for the rich is too far basically. I think every wage levels should have 10% increases so it would be more sensible and sustainable for our economy and we still have an ""equality"" in how much we earn after tax somehow. For example, A tax of 10% for under $39,999 and then 10% increase in tax for every $10,000 like between $40,000 to $49,999 and so it goes on. The higher you earn, the higher the tax it will be BUT it will still be same as the lower-wage taxpayers anyway? It is NOT fair for the entire society to pay on same tax amount. If the standard tax is 50%, and a family of five only earns $25,000 a year so that means they will only have $12,500 a year after tax comparing to a CEO who earns $250,000 a year and gets $125,000 after tax every year. That's extremely unfair. So that concludes my point that rich people SHOULD pay considerable tax price. I think it is unfair for us to charge rich people 80% tax, of course, but I think it is fair for us to charge them a reasonable tax price based on their wealth.",-1
18,"Isn't that more fair? Shouldn't everyone pay the same amount? In a word-- no. it's not more fair; it's appallingly unfair. Why? The rich should pay more taxes, because the rich get more from the government. Consider defense, for example, which makes up 20% of the budget. Defending the country benefits everyone; but it benefits the rich more, because they have more to defend. it's the same principle as insurance: if you have a bigger house or a fancier care, you pay more to insure it. Social security payments, which make up another 20% of the budget, are dependent on income-- if you've put more into the system, you get higher payments when you retire. Investments in the nation's infrastructure-- transportation, education, research and development, energy, police subsidies, the courts, etc.-- again are more useful the more you have. The interstates and airports benefit interstate commerce and people who can travel, not ghetto dwellers. Energy is used disproportionately by the rich and by industry. As for public education, the better public schools are the ones attended by the moderately well off. The very well off ship their offspring off to private schools; but it is their companies that benefit from a well-educated public. (If you don't think that's a benefit, go start up an engineering firm, or even a factory, in El Salvador. Or Watts.) The FDIC and the S&L bailout obviously most benefit investors and large depositors. A neat example: a smooth operator bought a failing S&L for $350 million, then received $2 billion from the government to help resurrect it. Beyond all this, the federal budget is top-heavy with corporate welfare. Counting tax breaks and expenditures, corporations and the rich snuffle up over $400 billion a year-- compare that to the $1400 budget, or the $116 billion spent on programs for the poor. Where's all that money go? there's direct subsidies to agribusiness ($18 billion a year), to export companies, to maritime shippers, and to various industries-- airlines, nuclear power companies, timber companies, mining companies, automakers, drug companies. there's billions of dollars in military waste and fraud. And there's untold billions in tax credits, deductions, and loopholes. Accelerated depreciation alone, for instance, is estimated to cost the Treasury $37 billion a year-- billions more than the mortgage interest deduction. (Which itself benefits the people with the biggest mortgages. But we should encourage home ownership, shouldn't we? Well, Canada has no interest deduction, but has about the same rate of home ownership.)",-1

Tell me why when corporations takes billions of dollars of tax subsidies, they are considered good businessmen, but when a homeless man needs food to survive, he's a moocher. The fact is both are taking advantage of the government. The difference is one is abusing the system for wealth, while the other is trying to get by.

Americans get very little in return for their tax dollars, as opposed to European countries where students need not worry about paying for college, boarding, or working whilst getting an education, or graduation in debt. Stresses most American students live with day by day.

After spending money in their stores the noble poor then begrudge the fact that they made money - go figure, or go somewhere else to shop. Wait, then the other retailer would make money, so they could be seen as evil too, just sayin'. At any rate we should tax the rich more, but who determines whose rich? Oh wait, I get to decide. It seems that most of the world is very poor, fighting for survival poor, not keeping up with the Joneses poor. I don't think that people in rural China, or somewhere in Africa can look at the American poor with big screen TVs, air conditioned homes, and air jordans and somehow think they're not rich. So lets start taking from the American poor with their comparatively elaborate lifestyle and give to the world - let's spread the wealth, or misery, depending on your view.

18,"I believe the question should really be, are those who should be paying taxes doing so? A few years ago a whistleblower in the Swiss banking system came forth with the revelation that roughly ten thousand wealthy Americans had stashed their earnings in Swiss banks without paying a penny in Federal income tax. Corporations have moved their earnings overseas to countries that have zero income tax. Decades ago corporation accounted for about 35 to 40 percent of all Federal tax intake. Now it is about ten percent. Smaller business should be lobby for their larger brothers to pay their fair share. Yeah sure we would all like to keep 100% of what we earn but I for one also want maintained roads, schools, police, fire, etc. For the libertarians who want government to go away and have corporations and the free market become the new government I say this. Much of the structure in which business operates is here because of government funding. The intranet is great example. No, Steve Jobs or Bill Gates did not invent it. The military with taxpayer funding conceived of the Internet as a means of more efficient interdepartmental communication. I would like to dispel some of the myths that I see here. 1) Not all of the wealthy are job creators. Some recent statistics show that less than ten percent of income of millionaires is derived from businesses. Most in the 1% earn their income from capital gains or from family money. Many of the very wealthy either don't own businesses or that is just a side show if you will. In the past when the tax rate was higher on the 1% it didn't affect hiring at all. 2) Not all people on government assistance are lazy. This come from the ""pull yourself up by your own boot straps"" mantra of libertarians. I work in a large hospital and my job takes me into the mental health wings. I also live two houses down from a group home. From personal experience we will always have people in society who don't have the ""boot straps"" to pull themselves up by. Do we just let them slip through the cracks? Someone has to provide for them. If not then we cease to be a civil society. 3) Most millionaires and billionaires earned their money. Ah, sorry but that answer is not always. Many, many of the wealthy in this country come from privileged backgrounds or got lucky in the stock market with an initially small investment. Yes, some people worked their fannies off and made good. I salute you! Also not all of us can be millionaires. The vast majority of American workers are hourly or salaried. their is almost always caps and restrictions on pay. If someone chooses that type of work it doesn't mean they are lazy or not ambitious. The reality is that the number of really high paying jobs is limited. I think most Americans work extremely hard.",-1

18,"Not all income is the same. When wealth exceeds the cost of need and income becomes discretionary, the ability of the wealthy to pay more is less and less of a burden. And the wealthy owe more to the society that's contributed to their success. Their wealth is dependent on the infrastructure of the nation. While the wealthy may work hard to accumulate their wealth, they also rely on government services, the educational system, banking etc. In order to achieve that success. Ideally, the wealthy should not have to contribute a disproportionate percentage of taxes, but wages and the wealth gap have created this need. If the minimum wage and middle class incomes had kept pace with inflation, we wouldn't be in our current deficit situation. their wouldn't be a working poor and the middle class would enjoy a higher percentage of income, thus paying more taxes. So until the income gap is is closed, the wealthy...Especially the very wealthy have to pay more. The first most logical step is repelling the Bush Tax cuts and taxing capital gains at the same rate as income. Trickle down economics as a fallacy. there is no logical reason for investment income to be taxed at a different rate. Our economy is consumer based and when income is more widely distributed, rather then concentrated in a smaller and smaller segment of our population, our economy is healthier. If you disagree, answer this question: What produces more jobs...The purchase of four $25K cars or one $100k care? Four times the manufacturing, four times the parts, four times the services, four times the fuel, four times the insurance, etc. The math cannot be argued.",-1

I still only get taxed 10%. So, 200K. I have a nice house, I saved up pretty quickly(less than two years) and was probably able to buy it outright. So I pay taxes, probably 30 to 50 thousand dollars a year. I still have over 1M left over for everything else I want. Many rich people are rich because of the family they are born in. their are very, very few possibilities for people to climb from poverty to riches.

Our middle class is vanishing, and their are very few wealthy people in this country in proportion to all of the other taxpayers. I believe that the wealthy people of America should pay a greater tax percentage in proportion to their income, because it would strengthen our social and economic infrastructure to ensure long term fiscal health of our country. their have been many times in our history where we have radically raised and lowered taxes for the wealthy. In the 1950’s and early 1960’s, the top bracket income tax rate was over 90%, and as a result, the economy, middle class, and stock market skyrocketed. However, in the 1920’s, the government lowered taxes on the wealthy, and there was a huge boost in the economy, but it only lasted a short time, like a sugar high, as it was followed by a very long bust in the economy, the Great Depression. History suggests our taxes should be rising soon, especially for the rich, as periods where the wealthy was taxed very low have been followed by periods where the wealthy was taxed extremely high.

But since they still need to do something with their money they face two possibilities: buy goods and services with the new higher tax, or invest the money (save it on a bank, invest on the stock market, etc.) Either one of these two possibilities would be good to the economy since the Revenue collected from taxes would increase (with the first possibility) and the savings would increase as well (with the second one.) And we know if their are higher savings, then interest rates would decrease, making it easier for people with lower income to invest (getting loans from banks).

The wealthy will benefit from it in the long run, since it will keep up the nation where they remain wealthy. What good will all those numbers do once America's economy crumbles?

I want to leave a safety net of wealth to my daughter to assure she will be OK when I die. So I understand the need to protect reasonable amounts of inheritance but I think if we put it to a vote most of use would agree that amounts beyond the average value of a house would be reasonable to tax at a high rate for the good of the country. I would also think that those who worked hard for their wealth would agree that working hard because you have to creates good character and good values in a person so why would they want to deprive their loved ones of that life lesson by giving them so much they may choose not to work and don't value what they have been given.,-1

18,"In fact, the United States wealth disparity is higher then in Tunisia and Egypt. The upper 5% of the population own two-thirds of private assets in the United States (in Germany for example they own less than half). The richest 400 Americans own more than the poorest 150 million Americans. Between 2002 and 2007, 65% of income gains went to the top 1%. Need I continue? The circumstances in the United States are becoming more and more like the Gilded Age (late 19th and early 20th century), when the heavy industry's Barons (like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie) owned most of the country's wealth while the poor masses worked in their factories and lived in poverty. Today's circumstances (wealthwise) are different by a few major factors - the wide and easy availability of credit, and minimum wage (though that is very low). The working-class people of today are - compared to the super-rich - almost as poor as the working class of the Gilded Age. They don't notice, because they can take up credit, and they do. This disparity is not due to economical developments, but mainly political decisions. Further, this development towards a new Gilded Age actually is dangerous to the economical growth of the United States, because the consuming middle class powers the economy. But middle class incomes since the beginning of the millennium have fallen by 10%. That means that the United States domestic market is shrinking quickly - the trend is accelerating - and that in turn means the economy will take a hit. That will probably cause a lot of rich people to lose a lot of money, if we don't raise their taxes before it happens. Finally, I would like to say to all the people on the Con that argue that lazy poor people should not burden the hard-working rich: most poor people don't choose to be poor. Many were born into poor circumstances, others took a hit in life and did not recover well. Most welfare recipients would probably rather work and make their own money. Then the middle class - they are getting poorer and poorer, too. And the 'hard-working' rich? I daresay that those people can afford to rid themselves of a little of their 'hard-earned' money. Especially if it saves not just our, but their economic future as well. Faced with these arguments, I can only support a significantly higher tax rate for rich people.",-1
18,"Income inequality has started to come into the light in recent years. Income inequality started to increase since the 1970's and even more so in the 1980's due to deregulating banks and decrease taxes to the richest. The simple truth is that the rich don't spend enough to benefit the poor. And most of the money the rich make are from employee compensation, meaning they wouldn't be making so much money if it wasn't for the hard work of their employees, no matter how insignificant one member might be in their big business. The rich should support the middle class and the poor by giving taxes to the government, which can be spent on social programs to better train and educate the poor, thus creating a better workforce for the rich. it's funny that tv programs try to say that the people should spend more to get rid of recession, which does help, yes, if the people have money to spend. Spending the money creates more money in other hands to be spent which all has sales tax to give to the government. However, the rich don't spend money like that, they save money. That's how they are rich and how they have been able to accumulate the money. And with all that money they can easily invest and acquire more money. This is considered investment tax which has less tax rate then income tax for the rich. So maybe what really needs to change is how taxes are designed. There was a point in history where the top percent paid 90% tax and they still came out with more money after taxes then everyone else.",-1

18,"My opinion comes from a different place then most I believe. Let’s look at the reason not to place policy to burden wealthy Americans with a higher tax. Ultimately, it’s don't because wealthier individuals want to keep more of their money in their pocket. It really is that simple. It is also very human, and completely understandable. The question is whether it is sustainable to allow heavier life costs onto the bottom of the economic ladder. We call it the bottom of the economic ladder because it’s our foundation, which is becoming week. Currently in America, citizens pay more of their income to be poor. That is because we have a huge credit driven system. Higher Debt to Income Ratios mean higher interest for credit, and lower credit scores. The poor are more likely to incur late fees, and overdraft fees from creditors and financial institutions. They are more likely to pay higher insurance premiums, drive less fuel efficient cars. Larger deposits for things like utilities, housing, etc. To offset that reality, I do believe that the individuals which have a higher income should incur the larger social debt. Make more disposable income available in a workers ""net"" income or ""bring home pay"", meaning the poor will have more buying power. Ultimately, what this boils down to is we need the poor to be fiscally active for the wealthy to remain that way. We as a free market, commerce driven society need our fellow citizens to have more disposable income, so that corporations may be able to consume that income. That statement isn't a knock at the system it is the reality. It is econ 101, the cycle of money, employer pays employee who in turn spends that money allowing other employers to pay their employees. If there was less tax burden on the poor, then, in my opinion we would have a healthier economic cycle. As an alternative, we could place the offset of the tax burden on Corporations above the line Profit.",-1

If born of another race, a police system that quite often targets and oppresses them. They have no money for college and generally no opportunities around them to succeed. their areas in America in this fabled, 'land of opportunity', that rival slums in developing country. David Simon said after his countless years in Baltimore, that there are two Americas and having travelled widely across America, I am inclined to believe him. So why not create a more equitable tax model? Why not tax the rich more money. As someone said above if you make 2 million dollars a year and you get taxed half of that how much will that really effect you? Do you really need that extra million to buy absurdly affluent things? I think you will be pretty safe to buy pretty much anything you want. What about those, who an increase in taxation effects their basic quality of life? Those who struggles to find the money on minimum wage to put food on the table and provide for their family. The word 'communism' and, 'socialism' are dirty words in America. Words, that are thrown around too much without people considering their implications. An equitable tax system as well as government that takes care of its citizens is not the beginnings of Communism but that of a truly equitable western consolidated democracy. I am implore anyone who throws out the word, 'communism' and, 'socialism', when anyone proposes a somewhat, 'liberal', idea by their standards to go see the poorest areas of any major city. You tell me if you all you see is, 'lazy people.' Rather, you will see thousands of people who are failed by this country every day. A more equitable tax system is among one of the many reforms this country needs to take if we are ever truly provide our people with the dreams, freedom and liberty the founding fathers promised so long ago.",-1
18,"People who are rich most likely did something to accomplish it. Whether it is sports, business, or music. They made the moves to get their. They worked their way through the hard times, and now it is paying off for them. We all have that same shot to accomplish those things, so why punish them for it?",1
18,"Be it as it may that the 1% own 80% of the wealthy, they pay 90% of all the federal income taxes in our country, Obama all the time says that everyone should pay their fair share, tell that to the 47% mr. president, why should the rich have to pay more so that the lazy can earn more for doing nothing",1
18,"We don't want to be punished for making money and pulling the economy further up . Nor do we want to encourage lazy people to further laze around , cos there are hardworking people out their making money and paying some of your share of taxes . Ridiculously ridiculous logic. It is so absurd to even argue on this topic. Doing this , you are further discouraging people who want to start new ventures , creating new jobs for the country , amplifying the recession we are in. Now that Obama is re-elected , the country's economic growth is very likely to slow down further. We don't want to be the second greece . Because Mr president has run out on options to make up for the 6 trillion deficit he accumulated in last 4 years(almost half of US debt) , does not mean he take such illogical measures to control the hampered economy. I come from a middle class and I find it so damn irrational to expect the person who worked hard for his money , to pay for my taxes. It is like saying - ""hey dude, Am too lazy to work , so now that i work so hard , do my bit of the share too"". If Obama really wants to work on his piled up debt , he rather work on cutting expenses ( 6 trillion debt ? ) , increase jobs ( and increase taxes obviously does the exact opposite - kills off jobs) , increase revenue ( by increasing the jobs and not taxes) . Romney made so much more sense when it came to understanding the economy and kick-starting it again and given his strong successful business background , he would have definitely don't a better job then Mr Obama. Increasing taxes , will definitely drive away all the wealthy investors away from US to elsewhere and god-forbid , push US economy further into irrecoverable recession.",1
18,"The purpose of taxes is to pay for government. Taxes should be based on how much government you are using rather then on how much money you earn. For example, I have no kids, no house, and no need for much of anything. I live a fairly minimalist lifestyle. Yet, I'm forced to pay for public education, public health care, public parks and artworks, social programs, police that enforce rules that I don't agree with, political campaigns for parties that I wish would fall off the face of the Earth forever, etc. How about this - total up what I really use, such as defense and roads and the court system, and then send me the bill. Total up what people who have kids are using, such as all the free education and health benefits, and then send them their bill too. In a system like that where the people receiving the benefits are directly coupled to the costs of those benefits, it would self-stabilize. Everyone would get exactly what they're willing to pay for, no more, no less. That's a fair system. The US government shouldn't even have the right to invade our privacy to find out what our income is or what our net worth is. All they need to know is what services we've used and how much. For example, when I go to the grocery store and buy milk, they don't ask me how much I make and then charge me more for the milk because of it. That's madness. Why do people think they have a right to know what someone else makes and then the further right to charge them more for the same thing? Why should one citizen pay more to live in this country then another citizen? I'm for a flat tax, and I don't mean a flat percentage of income or any other kind of flat ""rate""; I mean a FLAT tax, say $1,000/month per adult citizen. That should be more than enough rent to pay the landlord in order to live in this country. Whatever the united states government can't accomplish with that much money, they probably shouldn't be doing anyway.",1
18,"Absolutely not! Most of the wealthy people have worked their way up and worked their entire lives to get where they are, and if they are just being taxed because they have become successful, well that is just WRONG! My dad is a small business owner and he has worked since he was 15 years old to get where he is today. We are not rich, but we are not poor. We have to pay a lot of taxes, even though my dad has been working and pushing himself to have a nice family, house, and workplace. If the rich is taxed more, then that is just saying that it doesn't pay to be successful!",1
18,"No. Because they have worked for their wealth and deserve to receive the rewards. They should not be punished for making their way through this life and doing well. They've earned their wealth, and it's not fair for us to make them pay more taxes just because they've don't better in life then others. If we did that in school nobody would ever have the drive to succeed. Say that i received a D but my friend got an A Well she is ""richer"" then i am so how about we just take half of her grade and give it to me, so now i have a C and she has a C and she just lost half of her scholarship opportunities.",1
18,After 40 years as a small business person I become successful only to pay about 60% of my top income in the punitive CA and Federal taxes on the Obama/Brown plan. I have no pension or 401k-I need my profit for retirement! I spend my money more efficiently in my community then Obama/Brown can filter it through numerous agencies and red tape! Learn to be efficient before wasting more on repetitive services and failed policy. Allow entrepreneurs to CREATE demand by innovative products which the consumer will buy. Middle incomes don't pay more INCOME TAX then upper incomes and tax code is more punitive as income rises already!,1
18,"In My opinion it is completely unfair to make the rich pay more. The tax rate should not be based off of income it should be completely equal. Everyone was born the same way and everyone should be taxed the same amount. Rich people might have worked hard to become rich and the government shouldn't take their money. All the money that the rich make and give to taxes goes to welfare and welfare have people that don't try to get a job or don't even work hard, so the rich are wasting money on those kinds of people, which is completely unfair. Rich should be treated with same amount of respect and equality. Which by the way we have a 16-trillion deficit but it is not because we're taxing too little, it is because we're spending to much on economic growth, which is another issue that the United States has. Rich people became rich for either the actions they chose, or their luck for winning the lottery and shouldn't have to get that taken away from by the government. So therefore in conclusion WE already have the highest tax rate in the world and shouldn't have to increase that, and rich should be able to keep their money because of how they got all that money, they help us enough and shouldn't need to help anymore then they already are.",1
18,"it's seems so easy to say that we should tax richer people. On the outside they have more disposable income then the so-called poor and they may appear equipped to handle the higher tax. But this is not the case. Many people are wealthy because they don't spend their money helter skelter, they work hard to save, invest, and increase their wealth. Taxing them more, is like punishing them for doing what's best for them and their families. Many people who build wealth will go on to become philanthropist of their own free ,often helping their own family and others who may want to get ahead in life. In essence, don't they already pay more taxes then those who don't make that much? Aren't they more equipped to be innovators, work hard to provide the best services to the country. We should encouraging wealth builders, not demonizing them for being successful. What does this say to people who may not be as wealthy or those who are in the process of building wealth?",1
18,"The rich are often seen as overly ""lucky"", pompous, and sometimes lazy. What most people (99%) don't seem to grasp is that the rich have slaved their whole lives to reach their status. Most work up to 6-7 days a week, 8 hours a day, while the so called poor spend their days stationed in front of a television, collecting welfare and food stamps. The hard workers should not have to pay for those who don't dedicate any time or brainpower to solving their own problems. don't feel entitled to anything that you have not spent blood and tears over. That goes to you, Medicaid moochers.",1
18,"Taxes work in a bracket system. If you take the time to learn how that actually works, your see the it's fair and equal. How taxes by wealth simply means economic stress. Imagine learning $9,999 a year with 10% tax... You end with $8,999. But now you earn one dollar more... $10,000 dollars with 15% tax... You leave with $8,500, less than before. Besides, taxing richer people is like giving them a fine for proving Capitalism works... ""Oh, your rich? Here, let me punish you for it."" Using the Tax Bracket system, taxes are fair, but ultimately, richer people pay more in taxes. They lower their taxes with deductions, including mass donations. Any poor person can do the same. In fact, they do so much that 47% of Americans don't even pay income After putting in all the deductions. Yes, that is an actual statistic, Romney did know what he was talking about.",1
18,"I would probably buy a new care (and by new I don't mean extravagant, I mean not nearly breaking down like my current model). I would probably buy a house. I would probably take one vacation in the next year! I would be more inclined to dine out for dinner, or take my family to the movies. I would also donate more money. To my church, local, and national organizations. I would not be hesitant to take a promotion or advance myself or my career for high tax repercussions. The money I would spend would STIMULATE the economy, not take away from it. By giving to individuals who have more incentive to collect a check then to work for minimum wage or ANY wage, the money that working citizens have earned and given up to taxes is not stimulating anything other than a perpetuating cycle of laziness.",1
18,"The rich earn their money because they worked hard in school and with them getting taxed highly, it is like their money is going down the drain and the government does not use that money collected wisely. Everyone should pay the same taxes. The poor is paying less taxes but a lot of the ""poor"" people percentage are lazy people who could get a job, but they choose not to and the government rewards them with low price taxes. With the rich paying more taxes, the more money they lose and the rich need a lot of money to create more jobs. Let everyone have the equal amount of taxes.",1
18,"If business owners lose money, that's less money to pay lower class employees, which overall means less employment opportunities! The fact is not that rich people are ""selfish"" it's that they worked hard for their money and the majority of people who support this are people still breast feeding off the government! Get a job! Get two! Make sure you can support a family before you have five kids! Don't punish people who work hard for a living because of your poor mistakes! We all have the same opportunities in life, it isn't anyone Else's fault you chose not to grasp them!",1
18,"Notice how most of the people who say yes, say it's because it's the right thing to do or it's because they make more money. Guess what LAZY AMERICANS, these people worked hard for their money whether you believe that or not. They didn't get rich just by being stupid.. They don't want to pay more in taxes to help people who just sit around and do nothing all day just to get payed by our government. it's mind boggling to me how stupid some people are, like they are entitled to something just because they don't have it and other people do. This is America, don't like it? Then get out. Even when these people pay a lower tax rate they make more money than the average person does.. If you make 1 million dollars then you're probably going to be paying more in taxes that year then some people do in a lifetime..",1
18,"With the higher class of America being taxed a higher percentage, it will do no good. The more money a person makes a year the more money the government gets from them. Someone who makes $400,000 pays $80,000 to the government, while someone who makes $40,000 only pays $8,000. Since we are already paying more money, granted it is the same percentage, why raise taxes for the wealthy class?",1
18,"Equality is predicated upon everyone paying the same rate. In America, everyone should be taxed at the same rate, nothing less or nothing more. We all use the same goods, ie. Access to the same infrastructure, we drive on the same roads, etc. Why should the obligation of citizenship vary amongst different occupations?",1
18,"Everyone should pay the same tax percentage. Nothing is going to come free in this world, and distributing a well-off person's money to everyone isn't teaching anyone that lesson, it just teaches others how to be lazy and get money for not working. It discourages success. Nobody should be forced to support another person entirely, nobody should be paying for another person's healthcare or whatever. Someone is always paying for the ""free"" stuff a lot of people get.",1
18,"What do you mean fair share? If you people actually believe that then the poor should be taxed more, so that their payment can match that of a rich person. If a person who makes 250,000 dollars a year only get taxed 20% (50,000), then a middle class person who makes 100,000 dollars a year should pay 50% taxes. That way both the rich and middle class people pay 50,000 dollars.",1
18,"I believe we all should pay the same percentage because the rich earned their money and why penalize them for working hard to not be a dependent of the taxpayers. I am not rich, but feel they should fight and go to court, if they are forced to pay more as a percentage then most of us.",1

I got a job, woke up early and got home late to pay off college. Did the same to be able to buy a house. Doing the same to save for kids college and provide for their future. And for this I should pay more taxes. it's not luck for most people. it's hard work and dedication.",1

18,"If the rich are taxed more the middle class will be paying more. Most of these wealthy people are the business owners. If they are paying more out of their pocket to the government then the money has to come from somewhere, thus everyone will be impacted by this decision. Then who will be to blame.",1
18,Many rich actually spend their money. Some invest in businesses and on luxury items such as cars etc. Everyone has an equal opportunity so it's not fair to tax them more. Some of these liberals make me sick! They just want to tax the rich so much but don't realize that they worked very hard to get to where they are,1
18,it's different when it comes paying your fair share of taxes. But just because some people are rich doesn't mean you should go around making only those people pay an extra amount. They have worked hard to get their money. And it's not fair for you to take over 30% away from them.,1
18,"it's an OBVIOUS no because as it, well over 35% of their paychecks go straight to the government. So tax them more? To where they give up over half of THEIR EARNED paycheck? People on the left seem to not know the definition of EARNED or FAIR. This is fair to the left: Middle class pays at a tax rate of 14% while the ""stingy rich"" pays more than twice that. Yeah, real fair. What would be fair is if everyone was taxed, say, 10% right across the board, so it hurts EQUALLY and FAIRLY for everyone (the real definitions of equal and fair, I mean).",1
18,"I would much rather see a system that severely tightens the belt. Especially since we are in debt. In theory, maybe it would be better to reduce all spending by like 50%, double everyone's taxes for 3 years, and pay off the debt to reset. That is what I did when I woke up in a huge hole of debt.

18,"their seems to be some confusion about the so-called rich paying their fair share. I am in the upper 1% of income earners and I pay almost half of my income in taxes. Actually 48% of everything I make goes to state and federal tax. On top of that I pay property tax based on the value of my house so that too is a progressive tax. I have never complained about the taxes but do take offense when people imply that I don't pay my fair share. I believe everyone should pay something. It is unreasonable to assume that 1% of the population can support the other 99%. If every person earning an income paid something then the revenue would go up more then simply adding another 4% tax to the top earners. I do support that interest and dividend income as well as cap gains should be taxed at the ordinary income rate and that, in effect, would raise taxes on wealthy investors. It also seems a little unreasonable to ask, ""do you think other people's taxes should go up?"" I would suspect that most people are less concerned about someone else getting taxed and would actually be in favor of raising taxes on others to avoid have to pay their FAIR SHARE.",1

18,Regardless of how hardworking and ambitious a person is or how little a person prefers to work we all should have the equal opportunity to contribute to our government. The question posed 'Should the rich be required to pay higher taxes in the US?' is false to begin with. Those earning a higher income have and will always pay more in taxes. it's not a requirement...it's the way it is! The evidence is clear. What is bothersome are those that feel disdain for others who have more than them. We all need to ante up and pay our fair share.,1

Under this scenario if we know someone has more beer then i do, they should have to share it with people who don't have as much. The key is to do what many good people do, operate within a budget!!! quit spending more than we have and expect someone else to make it up because you didn't manage the countries money. This concept that the wealthy don't pay their share is a garbage. quit talking about % and let's talk about real $'s.",1

(My dad) AND someone had posted they should raise taxes on the wealthy because it goes to education. who wants to get an education when taxes will be so high at your new education required job that the person flipping burgers at the nearest burger joint gets to spend more money then you (with free health care and food stamps and housing)???? I see this everyday. I know people on both sides of the fence. I personally am not wealthy but what's right is right and this is wrong",1
18,it's not fair that those who work hard have to pay half their salary then those who work dead end jobs. That is why some rich people are taxed too much that they finally cannot afford their house payments. That is why we have more homeless people now then we did back then.,1
18,Why penalize the rich for their hard work. Raising taxes on the rich will just result in a huge shift of income into capital gains which will make matters a lot worse because less taxes will be paid. Work hard and pay to those that don't work is a great concept.,1
18,"there are two choices here. One is to support a government that's only duty is to protect private property rights and individual liberty or to support one that is authoritarian, socialisitic, and aims for redistribution of wealth. How does a government have the right to tell you how to spend your hard earned money. By levying income tax and then using the money as they fit is authoritarian and against individual liberty. The more power we as individuals cede to the government the greater the likelihood that they will trample our freedoms. Only rights we as human beings have is our right to our lives and our right to the fruits of our labour. Health care is not a right nor is welfare or social security. Why should you punish those people that have worked harder than the average person. I for one worked my butt off in high school, college, medical school and residency. I have amassed huge loans to pay for all of this. I sacrificed my twenties to become a doctor. Just because now all of a sudden I am making a lot of money is it fair that I should pay more than someone who didn't work hard. Should I have to pay for their poor decisions? I spent my twenties scraping by, saving money for school and some other people my age were busy partying and wasting money buying things they didn't need for instant gratification. Even when I was poor what kept me going was that I knew all my hard work working 80 plus hours a week would some day pay off. Honestly if I knew it wouldn't I would never have gone into medicine. it's just too big of a price to pay both economically and emotionally. Lets not reward mediocrity and laziness. This is not what the US is about. And for all those people who try to say countries in Europe are so great just look at what socialism has don't to the European Union. Nothing is free. You can't spend tons of money on things like pensions and social programs and have a non-working population.",1
18,"The wealthy class in America has worked extremely hard for its money.

Sure there are folks that fall backwards into money, but that isn't the norm.

This ends with those highly productive people striving to achieve or produce more. Why study to be one of the best whatever (doctor, scientist etc.) where you can just sit back and only do enough to make what others make... This is a capitalist society, people strive for wealth as the fruits of their labor.",1

Wealthy, hard working Americans should not need to pay MORE because THEY worked HARDER then the lazy non working americans",1
18,"if the top 10% already pay 71% of the taxes, what is considered fair? 100%? The problem with the USA today and this recent election is that the people who only take from the government have the same vote as the ones who give (ie the taxpayers). The takers can vote to have 100% of the income of the taxpayers and as long as the takers are over 50% of the voting population, the payers have no say. Consider this analogy. You are in a very hard class in college - say physical chemistry or calculus 4. You make an A. However, their are those in the class who did not do so well. They made Ds and Fs. So the professor comes to you and says ""Hey I am going to make your A a C so I can boost the grades of those doing worse than average."" Your shot at grad school got worse. Your scholarship may have gotten cancelled. All because you needed to share your success with the needier in the class. Even the most liberal amongst you has to see that this scenario is ridiculous. Yet that is what the ""tax the wealthy unfairly"" movement is about. What I would accept is a consumption tax. You could exempt basics like basic housing, basic food.... and tax luxuries. That way the double taxation on income then investment gains would go away. You could make a progressive tax so poor were exempt from things like food medicine and housing. But your heroes like Gore, Kerry, ... would be slammed by buying gigantic homes, yachts...",1

And also, no he isn't an evil money hoarder, I feel like that was just explained completely. it's easy to blame someone else and make them deal with our mess, but in reality, we are all to blame. If we REALLY want to solve this crisis, we must ALL pay more into taxes (buying less crap that decrease in value), and the government must spend less. Best Buy for example is losing lots of money. While they cannot raise their prices, they can DOWNSIZE by closing worthless stores. If you think the wealthy should pay more in taxes, you're absolutely right! Only you should as well. and your cousin, and neighbor and your unborn grandchildren, because this will take quite some time to fix.",1
18,"To the person who wants ""shared sacrifice"", where were you when I was sacrificing during 14 post-high school years of training making squat and working 100-hour weeks? The rest of my friends were majoring in business, going to football and baseball games, partying, traveling, you name it. At that time, I sacrificed basically my 3rd decade of life going to college and med school...where was the shared sacrifice then? Sorry...just yours truly. That is one problem with many of the arguments from the other side...they all assume that the ""rich"" we're either just created by chance (and they were lucky or ""fortunate"" as Obama likes to say)...or they all make 50 million bucks a year on wall street. The reality is that (1) most or all WORKED AND SACRIFICED for their wealth and (2) most people we are talking about fall into the 250k -- 500k group. You bust up taxes on them by 15% and that significantly hampers their plans for retirement, college, you name it. The $50 mil crowd won't feel it a bit, but the guy making 275k sure will. I'm not saying that it is OK to take the $50 mil guy's money, either. He was smart or talented enough to earn it--it doesn't mean that he did it on the backs of poor people (another assumption of the left). Finally, if you want to know how it feels to be in this upper bracket and have everyone want your money, imagine if our congress passed a law that said every American was compelled to send 15% of their income to Somalia to assist with rebuilding that country, ravaged by famine...the per capita income their is so low, even those in the US making 12k yearly would be considered wealthy in the average Somalis eyes. If you would protest, who needs it more? Who could live without it? Who has more than they need? I could point to the $50 mil guy and say ""yeah but he is REALLY rich"" just like a 12k guy could point to a 50k guy and say in the Somali argument ""yeah, but he is really rich"" ...rich is in the eye of the beholder.",1
18,"Reading the comments of those who agree, they mention that those who make less don't use all the infrastructure such as roads, firefighters, police service as richer people do. That is a lie. Everyone uses all these services, therefore the tax should be equal for everyone no matter if they make more or less.",1
18,"This country came about because we wanted freedom. Freedom from religious persecution and so on. Why now many years later are we losing sight of what we as Americans stand for? I don't want anybody running my life and telling me how to spend my money. I don't want things handed to me, I want to work for them. Our ancestors worked very hard, and not so that we wouldn't have to, but so that we would have even more opportunities than they did. I want control over my own life, my own job, my own health care. What happened to everybody being treated equally? How is it equal to take more money from somebody just because they make more? How is it equal to give somebody food stamps because they are too lazy to get a job, when I have to work for my money to pay for my food. Where's the equality in that? Where's the freedom?",1
18,"What makes one person any more important than the next? Just because one person has worked their way to the top over another person does not mean they should pay for the less fortunate. Work for what you want. Stop living off of the country's money like a parasite. People wonder why we are in so much debt. it's because so much of our money goes into the welfare system to pay for people to achieve nothing. That's not what this country is based on, and I bet if a person on Welfare won the lottery and had to pay higher taxes because they were 'wealthy' they'd be singing a different tune.",1
18,"California just passed Proposition 30 to bolster the failing education system. The state will increase sales taxes for all residents. That's fine. But at the same time, California under Proposition 30 is FORCING anyone with an income of $250,000 or more to pay higher income taxes for the next seven years. My husband and I just arrived at that income bracket because of stock options. We live in a 1,500 square foot house, which needs new updated bathrooms and a kitchen, and has a leaky roof. We also drive 14 year old cars. Our house has lost at least $300,000 in value and our property taxes increase yearly. And here's the big kicker, when the Bush tax cuts expire, we will be forced to pay much higher federal taxes. By the time we end up paying for all the taxes imposed on us because we now have an income of $250,000 (again because of stock options), we will barely be able to live. We won't be able to go on vacations, and it is iffy whether we will be able to afford to send our son to college. Everyone should pay their fair share in taxes, regardless of their income. Our president has a Robin Hood mentality and his new protege is Governor Brown.",1
18,"I believe we should have a flat tax rate with absolutely no deductions. I personally got back more than I paid in last year and while it wasn't fair, I took it. If taxes are percentage based and everyone has the same percentage, then it is a fair system. We are assured of the right to pursue happiness.",1
18,"Instead of continual talk about the deductions and loopholes the rich take advantage of (oh, they're legal and talked about like it's a criminal act to follow the tax law), why doesn't the government actually do its job? Maybe balance a budget every now and then. Or rewrite the tax code. And if rich people want to pay more taxes, let them.",1
18,"The rich should be allowed to do whatever they wish with their hard earned money. They deserve it completely because they worked for it. Obama is simply taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor. It is obviously a sin. The lower class, middle class, and upper class should all pay the same percentage of taxes",1
18,"The rich already pay the majority of all federal income taxes. Just because someone makes more doesn't mean they should be made to pay for everyone who doesn't have the desire, work ethic or intellect to be successful. We all are not equal. I'm sick and tired of hearing this rhetoric from Obama. He will eventually succeed in driving the wealthy job creators from this country. It will be cheaper for them to invest elsewhere.",1
18,"Tax system is unfair because if you have a higher income you have to pay more. Rather then the poor, who earn little and pay little. Imagine this, a couple makes 60,000 a year and another makes 300,000- 5 times more than the 60,000 a year couple. The 60,000 year couple pays 2,069 but the 300,000 a year couple pays 68,950, they are paying around 33 times more than their supposed to. Also, even though we have a 16 trillion deficit, it is not for taxing to little but because we are spending way too much on economic growth. The countries with the lowest tax rates- like Chile and Singapore- have the fastest economic growth. We instead have the highest tax rate in the world!!!",1
18,it's stupid for those who work hard and make a lot of money to have to turn around and give a big chunk of it to lazy people that don't care about making a living or want to succeed in life. Everyone should have to pay the same amount in taxes. I believe 10% is a good percentage everyone should have to follow.,1
18,"The problem isn't tax rates, it's the loopholes. Taxes are calculated as percentages and scale themselves. Why should someone who makes a lot of money give up a much higher percentage of their money then anyone else? If you don't make much, you don't pay much; you make more, you pay more. That's how percentages work.",1
18,Just because someone made a better living and more money shouldn't mean that we give them higher taxes. Lots of people had to work hard for that money and worked their way to the top. And in this country we're lucky to have the right to be able to do that. We should thank them for providing capitalism to our economy.,1
18,"Let's say income tax is a easy, low 10% for all citizens (opposed to our system where rich people pay a higher percentage anyways) A poor person making 10,000 dollars a year pays 1000 dollars in taxes A rich person making 10,000,000 dollars a year pays 1,000,000 dollars in taxes That rich person would be paying 1000 times more real money then the poor person, and somehow that still isn't fair enough? By the way, right now, poor are taxed 10%, while today's rich person would actually be paying 40% tax. their for the rich person making ten million a year already has to give the government 4,000,000 just in tax. The rich person would actually be paying 4000 times more than the poor person in America today. Is that not enough? Is 4000 times more money not their ""fair share?"" I don't think the government is in the place to ask them to pay any more than that, taking half of their hard-earned money away from them.",1

18,"nothing prima facie wrong about having more property than someone else. Taxes are already proportioned with a percentage of someone's total property, and distinct percentages actually add an element of unfairness to the system. A flat tax with intrinsic tax proportionality is the way to go, not an unfair system that punishes the rich simply for being rich.",1
18,"Here is the way this breaks down. Last year, I paid over $120,000 in federal income tax. Compared to the average taxpayer, who is earning less and in a lower bracket, let's say I paid 6 times more in taxes. And, I'm fine with that. But, what I'm not fine with is the statement that I'm not paying my ""fair share"" I'd say that paying multiple times the national average is already a fair share. The problem is, if the rules of the game are ""let's ask those that don't have to pay the dues whether to raise the dues this year"" what do you think will happen with the dues.",1
18,More taxes put on the wealthy will only encourage them to move out and in turn lose tax revenue. Taxes are good the way they are not higher or lower. What we should do is lower government spending and keep our budget balanced or else we will increase our deficit and further the burden we place on the generations and generations to come.,1
18,"Flat tax allows everyone to pay the same percentage on income. If you ultimately make more, you pay more...if you make less, you pay less. That is fair and equal treatment to all taxpayers. What is the incentive to be successful if you are faced with the potential of contributing more than a fair share? Unequal taxation just causes the wealthy to try and hide wealth and look for methods to lower taxes. The non-wealthy lose motivation to increase earnings due to facing higher taxes. What do the taxes fund anyway? Things that improve our society, right? Things that all taxpayers should contribute equally to and have equal access to, right? Do the wealthy get access to more because they contribute more than the non-wealthy? Of Course not! Make taxes flat! The wealthy will still contribute more, the non-wealthy will still contribute less, but everyone will contribute at the same base rate.",1
18,"The rich had to go through lots of things as to where they are right now. So why should their money be funding the people who are on drugs?! They had to work hard to achieve their goal and now their taxes are going towards people who aren't exactly putting an effort in their life! I understand that there's the perspective of the homeless and the disabled, but if we keep on putting exceptions towards everything then might as well let us all sit back and wait on each other to do our own dirty work!",1
18,"Many people who are middle class have to work hard, but poor people just sit on the couch doing nothing. My dad was pretty much broke when he came here, now, hes middle class and is still going. We pay lots of money and is making us broke again. That is my opinion",1
18,"If the top 1 or 2 percent of US citizens are required to pay more taxes, the rich and successful are being punished for their hard work. And where does the money go to? The lazy people in the US who don't deserve it. Why should the poor get benefits if they don't even work for it? Therefore, the consequences (taxes) should not go to the wealthy.",1
18,"If someone who makes 100,000 has to pay 10,000, then someone who makes 10,000 should have to pay 1,000 and someone who makes 1,000 should have to pay 100. That way, the burden is equal for everyone. People who earn more money generally benefit the least from government resources anyway. A two-income-earner household, for example, will pay a higher percentage of taxes because they'll have more income by the fact that both able-bodied adults in the home are working, but will be far less likely to qualify for WIC, Headstart, FAFSA, Medicaid, and other government benefits. Households with higher incomes are also less likely to use the penal system. All of those things cost money. Making higher earners pay a higher percentage is simply a way to take away from the ""rich"" and give to the ""poor."" That isn't the government's job.",1
18,"Taking funds from anybody, rich or poor, is immoral. The majority should not get to determine what I or you or some rich person gets to do with their wealth.

18,"Government is one of the biggest causes of social strife in our world. When governments treat one group differently from another, people who identify with one group view people from the other group with suspicion, and eventually hate. The policy becomes a contentious issue people argue about, and the arguments are rarely resolved in a productive way. Government's line between ""poor"" and the rest of us is arbitrary, just as it's line between ""rich"" and the rest is arbitrary. If this is indeed a country where people are treated like equals, they should be equal in rights at the very least. And that means your right to the fruits of your labor (or your investment, or anything else) should not diminish just because there's more of it.",1
18,"I hear a large number of people saying yes, the rich should pay more, but what do you consider rich? Rich to me means having enough money to have a life full of vacations and no job. I hear, that the rich are selfish and should be more considerate of the poor. I would like to point out one profession that is being hung with the latest changes to the tax code and Obamacare; doctors! Most believe doctors are rich, and from first look, it seems they would be with a family physician making $120k and surgeons making almost half a million in some areas per year. But I would like to point out the tax rate is now 39% for anyone making over $200k. So let's take that surgeon who has built up $150k in school loans, and goes to college for more than twice the amount of most other professions. Now, that surgeon has paid his dues and gets his lets say he's one of the lucky ones making $500k. Sounds like a lot. Now let's add taxes. 39% = $195k. More than most American makes in 2, 3, maybe 4 years, yet the later is always asking for the rich to pay more. Now let's take into account malpractice insurance which is averaged at about $90-175k for Florida surgeons. Does any of your jobs require you to pay for insurance that costs this much? At the end of the day, after taxes and malpractice insurance, let alone other expenses and 80 hour work weeks, out of a half a million, the surgeon takes home $130k, and that's if he's one of the highest paid, not even the average salary. Then, with Obamacare looming, doctors are now going to take further pay cuts because currently the government only pays 60% of their Medicare and Medicaid claims. So cut that salary by 40% because of write offs by the government. Yes, the rich should pay more, is always the chant of those who don't have. Doctors worked very hard for their wealth, yet, they are being asked to give up more and more for the lazy of this country.",1

People who have a lot of money, got that money through hard work, they don't want to pay for somebody else and just throw that money away.

Drugs or other things that ruined their finances. That is their problem not others.",1
18,"One could easily argue that stocks drive this economy. The wealthy are the people who spend the most amount of money in stocks.

18,"If the Government taxes the rich more than they should it would be chaotic watching the rich not be able to higher more people for their business, so then in order for the rich to keep their businesses they would have to lay off employees, then that would mean that the economy would get worse and the debt limit will sky rocket. All because the government taxed the rich more than they should have.",1
18,"I don't think they should pay extra taxes because most of them give their money away anyways. It is not like they are keeping all of the money for themselves, plus they worked very hard for it [I'm not talking about inheritances] So why should a hard working citizen have to pay more than every other hard working citizen, taxes pay for road, schools, government organizations, etc. They contribute their fair share, with the regular tax given to everyone.",1

Have fun being a communist. If we decide that if you make a higher income, you pay a higher tax, what's the point in working hard and making more money? You're just going to be handing out your hard earned money to those with no drive. Our DEMOCRATIC government does not have the right to force people to be generous or unselfish. The fact of the matter is that Americans are becoming apathetic and want to live off others' hard earned money whilst they sit back on their lazy butts.",1

18,"Okay to everyone who said rich people have to pay more taxes, just think about how it would feel if you worked hard your whole life to earn something but you had to give a lot of it up because other people got mad that they didn't have it.

To everyone who thinks rich people should pay more taxes I bet if you had a lot of money your opinion would change.",1

If you couldn't be responsible enough to pay attention in school, work your ass off for a job, and do your job right, earn money, and not rely on the government, then that is your problem. The rich worked their butts off to get to where they are and to earn the money they do so why should they have to get a raise, just to get paid the same amount because of this idiotic idea of taxing the rich more. I wouldn't work as hard knowing I have to give money to the government to offer welfare and food stamps to those who chose to live the life they don't doing much.",1
18,"Rich people work just as hard if not harder. They work to get into where they are and the government punishes them for hard work. The poor have given up or are single mothers and or fathers or they were at one point, how have kids too early so they don't have time to try hard or have time to get a proper education. A lot of times they have been or are alcoholics smokers or drug attics. None of those help with being successful. A flat tax doesn't penalize the poor or the rich for working hard or not hard enough. It allows everyone to have opportunity but it doesn't decide who should have how much money.",1
18,They shouldn't have to pay more because they worked just as hard to get their. If you want to tax people for working harder and being creative you are unfair. A flat tax would not favor or discriminate any group or social class. It would make it fair for all.,1
18,"The rich shouldn't be taxed more just because they work hard and happen to get lots of money doing so. They are the majority of the economy. If the rich are taxed less, then they can build up their companies which can greatly help our economy. Yes, America is in large debt and the rich paying more will help us do so but if we have a better economy, then the government will have to fund it less and could (and should) focus on paying off the debt BEFORE spending trillions of dollars more. I really don't want this country to go down into flames because of these issues. Our government was already shut down for quite some time and I don't want that to happen again.",1
18,"Oh yes. They should definitely make the wealthy pay more, so all the money can go to lazy people who can easily work, and some who have a ton of kids and can't support them.

18,"My grandfather was not born into wealth, he was born very very poor, so poor that his father could not even afford to buy food for his family. My grandfather did not by any means have any special advantages or opportunities that other people had. When my grandfather was growing up, he read books like ""The Great Gatsby"", and fell in love with the glamorous lifestyle that the character Jay Gatsby possessed. My grandfather devoted his life to obtaining this glamorous, rich lifestyle. He single handedly brought himself up from being a very poor person, to a multi-millionaire just by sheer work-ethic, determination, and pride. Nothing in his life was ever handed to him, he had to go out and get it. Should people like this be taxed more? Absolutely not. It is just wrong, immoral, and unfair that a self-made successful man should be punished for a life of hard work and determination. He had just as much opportunity as any other poor person, and instead of just sitting on his ass complaining about why he didn't have money, he actually got off his ass and made something of himself. A lot of poor people think rich people had everything handed to them and that they deserve to have their money dispersed among the poor. It is simply unfair that a lot poor people can be lazy and collect welfare(my father's tax dollars) for doing virtually nothing. Anyone who thinks that rich people should be taxed more, is just jealous, irrational, lazy, and a whiner. People who complain about rich people should stop complaining and try and find a way to better themselves. If someone as poor as my grandfather was could do it, then so can you. It all comes down to this; if you really want to be rich and better yourself, then you can do it, it just won't be nearly as easy as you think.",1
18,To forcibly take money from the rich for the sake of supporting the poor is immoral and goes against the founding principles of liberty. If you punish people for being rich and successful they will have less motivation to pursue success. This creates a chain reaction and hurts everyone in a capitalist society.,1
18,Income taxes are based on income that people are EARNING... Not on their inheritance from being born into a wealthy family. The rich who have inherited their wealth don't pay higher taxes for just being rich. They only pay on what their income is each year.

Now, 9 years since college, that I am finally making more than $13 per hour I have to pay 35-40% of my income in taxes! And pay off all my school loans. I fully agree with the prior comment: ""people who think they deserve money for nothing are the real nuisances to our country."" Where is the incentive for people to work hard? If you don't reward people for hard work in this country you will have fewer interested in working hard, that may be our demise. A country where everyone feels entitled to things and not willing to work over 80 hours per week for them!",1
18,Jealousy? Is that it? Because I think if you're rich you're a hell of a lucky person whether you worked your butt off for it or you were born into it. So you're fate wasn't as good as someone else's? That's life. Just because you're miserable doesn't mean other people that have it better then you should have to pay.

18,Many people are under the false assumption that tax hikes will translate into more tax revenue. But these people don't realize that higher taxes alter incentives and human action. People will be deterred from starting new enterprises and expanding their businesses which means that production will be curtailed. High taxes will ultimately result in lower tax revenue and hampered job growth.,1
18,"The poor has no right to put such pressure on the rich to pay more taxes. These people are rich because of their hard work, luck and dedication. What would the poor do if they were in the shoes of the rich? They definitely won't allow it. Taxes can be raised but not to an insane height.",1
18,"It is not fair for the rich to pay more taxes than other people. They worked hard to get to here they are now. Why do they deserve to pay more taxes? Most of the rich are job creators, so when you give them higher taxes they have to start cutting workers.",1

18,"The argument that the rich should give more for the better good is absurd. Someone who steals from a grocery store just to feed his family is still a criminal. That may sound harsh but it's true. Stealing something from someone for a good cause doesn't make things right. Also, the rich already gives more than their fair share. They are taxed at a higher bracket then everybody. I don't think that's fair and I don't get why people think otherwise. it's COMMON SENSE! If everybody were taxed at the same percentage amount, the rich would still be paying more so why is it okay for the government and the people that think that they should pay more, to tax them at a higher percentage? Also, ""the rich works hard but the middle/lower class works harder"" argument is ridiculous. Let's say every single person in America works soooo hard. Life isn't about who works harder. there's no guarantee that if you work 'hard' life will give you a golden pavement to walk on. it's about circumstances, risks, luck, and being smart about your decisions. So the argument that since the middle/lower class work harder than the rich doesn't really help the argument. People are responsible for their own circumstances and situations in life. While you're looking at others to blame for your own life, the rich is too busy minding their own business (sometimes literally). Also, if the government keeps taxing the rich, the rich who employs most of the middle/lower class won't cut their profits or reach into their pockets, what they will do is drop and lay off their employees! So if you're working for a company which I'm assuming a lot of you are, maybe you should stop biting the hand that feeds you and be grateful for those rich assholes that they hired you so you could support your family! I think America is starting to get into this mentality and are becoming more complacent and entitled. it's sickening. America is known to be the land of opportunities. their are so many things that America can offer it's people (except affordable health care) so why are Americans starting to complain and look for others for help. This is a competitive country and socialism isn't going to work here. People move to America so they can get ahead and build something for themselves. People who still have that vision, takes risks and compete and that's a big factor for their successes. A lot of the rich didn't get to where they are in a snap. They got their because they wanted to be their, they had a vision, and they made it happen. Also, some people don't understand that owning a business is a great risk. there's no safety net for business owners if their business tanks. Business owners bare the full weight of their company. it's not a 9-5 job. When you own a business, you don't ever stop working.",1
18,"So stereo typing rich or poor all into one category is wrong. Not everyone rich person inherits, not everyone rich person works harder, etc. I personally started working at 10 years old legitimately when you could do that legally. I am 55 now. I never finished college. I never inherited money and I came from a poor family. I remember working 6-7 days per week and sacrificed my health to try and make it because in America everyone has a chance. Each weekend I watched all of my neighbors and friends take off in their boats and RV's and have fun while I worked and started businesses. In 2006 I lost everything and more in the real estate nightmare. I still carry hundreds of thousands in debt from that mess that I cannot write off. I didn't walk away from my creditors as I was taught to do the right thing. Just in the last couple of years, our business finally started to pay us a substantial income and now all I hear from our President and the media is that I didn't get their on my own and that I need to pay more and more taxes including health care for others. My net worth is not that much, but because of my income, now I am considered rich and in the top 2-5% so I need to pay. Maybe I would have been better off feeling sorry for myself and just worked a job and collecting help from the Government whenever possible and spent my time voting for higher taxes for rich people. What the heck is wrong with you people? You may not become Bill Gates and live in a mansion, but if you work hard in this country, you can better yourself. It is really easy to sit back and say that rich people need to pay for everything. I would bet everything that I have that if some of you came into money or started a business and was fortunate to make money that you would definitely change positions and vote for everyone paying into the system. I have not seen all of these amazing loopholes that you guys talk about. Please tell me where they are since so many of you that don't have money know all about these benefits to high income earners. Most of my life I have been on the less fortunate side of this equation and I didn't get jealous and envy other people's toys. It inspired me that I live in America and that I too had a chance of making a good life for my family. Some of you that do nothing but complain should really spend your energy on what you can do instead of what you don't have.",1
18,"The whole argument is based on economic equality, or a communist's dream: For everyone an equal amount, no matter what the job was. The only people who should be able to alter the income of anybody, in money alone, should be only one person's choice. The person to whom the money belongs to. Otherwise, it is simply a roundabout way to rob someone. That makes it illegal.",1
18,"We shouldn't discourage people from working harder and earning more by taxing them more. They will have less of an incentive to participate if they don't reap the rewards of their own labor. The term ""rich"" is arbitrary and can be applied to anyone who makes more than the average national income. Not everyone is equal, and not everyone deserves to be equal. Ultimately it is more of a crime to attempt to make two things that aren't equal, equal. We should recognize that not all individuals deserve to have the same privileges.",1
18,"Most of the wealthy own many assets that they rely for income and so are already taxed more harshly then the regular citizen. Also, they have worked very hard to earn the money they do have so why should someone who actually contributes more to society than most people be taxed more harshly than those who contribute next to nothing? It makes no sense at all",1
18,"Lately this idea that the ""rich"" deserve to have a higher income tax because they can afford it. If 40% of their income is being paid in taxes, how are they expected to donate to charities and help those in need out if they're now paying almost half of their income? Think of wealthy business owners, suppose they weren't able to pay all of their workers enough because of higher tax rates and someone finds themselves out of work because they were forced to lay off some workers. Now an employee out of work demands that the rich be taxed because it isn't fair that they're living a life of luxury while their out of work. If the business owner hadn't been taxed so harshly the worker may have been content with a uniform tax rate. Wealthy philanthropists already create and support colleges, charities, and public buildings. Many are already contributing a large amount of their money for the benefit of others. Those who worked hard enough to earn that money should not be punished, fore say, for helping boost the economy and help their communities. What's the point of earning more money if you'll just be taxed more? Why not be paid by the government to be unemployed?",1
18,"The problem with high taxes on rich, would cause them to find ways to still make money for their business. By hiring less people and rising prices, the rich are the ones that pay employees, so the government ends up killing the economy with their high taxes. I think 50% tax is unfair, the government takes robs you legally. I don't think the government knows Math or wants more cash for their pockets. I will be using small percents for this example, 10% of $20,000 is $2,000 and 10% of $100,000 is $10,000. If you do the math the taxes are different. Taxing different percentages based on your income is unfair and unjust in my opinion.",1
18,"This is a unreasonable way to do taxes. Making people who worked hard for their money pay more. Not only that but it encourages poor people to stay poor and not work because they have fewer taxes. Instead they should give people taxes for owning things. Ex: Own a house, get taxes on house, Own a care, get taxes on care, own a boat pay taxes for a boat, etc.",1
18,"Most of the Rich either earned or inherited the money that they have, even if they have inherited the money someone down the line in their family had to earn it. And the right thing to is for the Government to cut their spending and or redo their tax brackets",1
18,Well the rich are wealthy businesses owners and the big businesses make money for the economy. But when you tax them their businesses can grow and make a lot more money. The rich also give a lot of money for other things like to disease and other good causes. That's why i think we should not tax the rich as much.,1

Why not give it to someone in need? After all, you can afford losing one pair. The thing is, you don't want to; you have the choice because you worked hard and paid for the socks. All American citizens have the same chance of success. it's you being willing to take that chance that makes the difference.",1
18,"Why should they be forced to carry the poor? Because they can isn't an argument. If you have more than one shirt no one forces you to give up the extras to the poor. No one forces you to give up a kidney because you can. it's their money. Because they were born into it? So what!! It still *their* money. If you don't like where you are in the system then fix it yourself, don't require the rich to pay for you.",1
18,"I don't believe that the rich should be required to pay more taxes then the rest of us. Being rich does not just happen to people. In order to become rich, you must make the right decisions and work harder. The question is, should the poor be dragging down the rich? For instance, if you have two students, and one has a 4.0 GPA and works very hard, while the other has a 2.0 GPA and doesn't try that hard, should we take away some of the GPA from the higher student and give them both a 3.0? No, because one of the students worked harder for it and made the right decisions.",1
18,"That might seem like a silly thing to say when we're talking about taxes, but it makes sense. The rich are the same as the poor. Just because the rich have more money then the poor (obviously) doesn't mean the rich should have to pay extra taxes because of it. That's not really fair and it makes things unbalanced. Everyone should be treated the same, and therefore should have to pay the same taxes.",1
18,"Taxes are not meant to redistribute money and wealth, they are designed to fund the government to enforce its laws and duties. The problem is not income inequality, it is opportunity inequality. In fact, the Constitution before 1913 when the 16th Amendment was ratified, direct taxation was ILLEGAL! Only indirect taxation (like a sales tax) was permitted. Indirect taxes are much more efficient and fair. People who don't utilize the public school system in the area shouldn't need to pay property taxes to fund that, just like people who aren't driving don't pay a gas tax. Every needs to eat (pretty sure), so it is fair that everyone pays a sales tax at the store. Your income shouldn't dictate how many taxes someone pays. Indirect taxes paying for specific services are more efficient that direct taxation on everyone with the government deciding how much to spend on what.",1

Except that the tax collection from > 1 million bracket has actually FALLEN in France instead of rising! Except that the measure has cost France huge setbacks with unemployment highest since 90's, it being still in recession while even Spain and Italy are recovering. The deficit is rising faster now! The government is hugely unpopular and in a state of panic not knowing what to do! Now they are crying that look, it's not our fault, it's the fault of all those selfish rich guys who have fled to UK and other countries.

18,I'm in favour of low taxes for everyone but we can't taxing the rich because the rich end up leaving and if it's a CEO the taxes hurt the company which hurts employees and shareholders. When the rich go poorer the middle class get higher taxes and they suffer the worse so in the end everyone goes poor so no high taxes for anyone.,1
18,"Unless they make money in the multi-millions, relatively rich people (500k year) should not pay taxes. People think that all rich people got their money from a trust fund set up by Daddy, who buys her a mansion for her birthday and a new sports care every month. It is not so. Most rich people work incredibly hard to get their. A surgeon, like myself, will work 14 hours a day and is virtually always ""on-call"" (you have to be within 15 minutes of the hospital in case of emergency.) I'm not okay with MY money being spent on people who watch Oprah for a life and live off the dole. I think that there should be a flat tax rate between the 50k year and 500k a year.

We do plenty and then get slammed by the government and especially Obama and are forced to pay more.. it's so unfair. It really gives no motivation to work hard.. Why would you if you could get money from Obama? So stupid... As my husband works 60 hour weeks, many people are doing nothing yet still getting enough money.. So ridiculous",1

18,"Yes, rich people have it easy in many different ways, but we should analyse it for a second, if you have been smart (invested, avoided checks etc...) it is obvious you will pay less taxes regardless of your social status, which translates to, paying taxes is not about having more or less money but about financial education",1

18,"their is so much envy, and so many assumptions and biases that revolve around this question. Many of poor are unfortunate, and many of the rich do work hard, but this cannot be the foundation for an answer to this debate. First, we live in a country founded on capitalistic principles. This gives everyone a chance at reaching the pinnacle of economic freedom. Obviously, not everyone will reach the point, but that is not what makes the economy run. If everyone is not reaching, striving, working hard, and believing that if they do so they can provide more for themselves and their families, capitalism does not work. So whether rich people deserve their wealth or whether poor people deserve a better quality of life cannot be argued, because no one has the ability to discern what someone truly deserves; it is a moot point. But their must be rich people, or their is no incentive for others to strive for that position in life. When rich people are punitively taxed in relation to the percentage of their income, the incentive to work hard and reach a higher level of income is diminished, because that higher level of income does not promise a much greater quality of life. Even worse, this government provides incentive to remain in a lower tax bracket by redistributing money from the wealthy people to poorer people through welfare. This creates the gap between the rich and the poor that many complain about. The poor remain poor in income level, but have enough welfare to discourage them from finding a higher paying job. The rich and middle class make enough after taxes to discourage them from finding lower paying jobs so they can receive welfare. This ensures that the gap between the rich and the poor will always remain. High taxes for the rich is for the socialistic purpose of redistributing wealth. When wealth is redistributed, the incentive to work hard, to excel, is destroyed. This incentive drives the country; if it is killed, everyone in the country suffers because no one is productive. While their seemingly may be enough money in the country to go around now, continuing to increase taxes for those with higher incomes will eventually create a state of affairs where the money runs out. I will now provide a syllogism. Higher taxes on higher incomes along with wealth redistribution destroy work incentive. Work incentive drives a capitalistic economy. Therefore, higher taxes on higher incomes will destroy the economy. It is plain to see that such a path should not be pursued.",1
18,My family has worked since they were all young and we all are middle class people. Yes it may seem unfair but it's not because when they tax the rich people more they tax everybody just a little bit more than they used to so you guys who are saying yes are not thinking about how the government works. They try to make it fair but it is not fair. If everybody gets taxed more how much more will the poor people be taxed? A lot more than they have in their pockets is the answer.,1
18,"Rich people may be so because they inherited money,houses...Some others may be rich due to illegal sources and many others worked hard to become at that level.

The unrealistic ideology that we are born and created equal and therefore entitled to the Same income and standard of living is ridiculous.

18,"The poor are pitted against the rich in a battle in which they seem to think is unfair. They constantly are led to believe that the rich owe them money. But, ask a lower-middle-class member to fork over %40 of their salary-- forgetting about having to pay for healthcare, college, etc.--and they will refuse to do it. Why? Simply because no one wants to give up their hard-earned paycheck to someone else. So, I ask the question, how does the idea that the rich owe such large portions of their salary to those of the middle class promote anyone to be ambitious or work hard to become the 1% if they can be comfortable having someone else paying for their expenses where they are? The 1% cannot stay the 1% forever. At the rate that they are taxed, their money will eventually run out. Maybe not in their lifetime, but in their children's, or their children's. They will be forced to give the money to those who may not work as hard and feel they are entitled to someone else's money. Granted, their are people that need help: people that are ill, veterans, disabled--that deserve the benefits that this country promises. However, not all those who benefit from the money of the rich are worthy. That being said, they will never rise up to become as successful as the 1% because they will never have the drive. If you can do as little work as possible and still live comfortably off someone else's money, why wouldn't you? Why would you want to rise to the top only to have all your money taken away? What would be the point if you could do less work and ultimately benefit in the same way as the 1%? Eventually, this mindset that the rich owe more in taxes will backfire...Because their will be no more rich to call upon once the money has run out. So I guess the real question is...Then what will the greedy middle class do?",1

They already pay more tax than everyone else so why would they have to pay even more to the government when they don't even use the facilities that their money is going towards. it's so ridiculous to make people pay for the things they don't even use. Not to mention the fact that they are paying for the government bludgers, why should they have to give the lazy people MORE money for being lazy. You might say that they are being selfish and their money could be going to charity's or hospitals, well you couldn't even count the amount of money that rich people donate to the charity's and causes that they support each year. it's their money and they should be able to spend it the way they see fit. it's not their responsibility to pay for the less fortunate.

18,"there's a huge misconception among people in what constitutes someone being ""rich"". it's convenient for people to assume everyone in the 1% bracket makes millions of dollars a year in income, and thus it's easy to gang up on these folks to take their money because they are 'greedy, privileged' people. What about the person who after years of sacrifice and hard work gets to an income of 200k/ yr. Sorry, no private islands and limos here. After the huge chunk of taxes paid that take home amount is laughable compared to the original 200k. People on the other side of the debate seem to think they are working harder and more deserving and should pay less tax, and vote with their 'feelings' that people who were more successful then they were should be punished for it. Since we all think we work super hard for our jobs (something we can't really measure anyway) why not we all get taxed 'fairly' no matter our income? Shoot, just do a flat % rate and that would take care of the argument, even if higher earners would still pay more. This 'rich' person still has dreams of his/her own and shouldn't be stifled by a government/people who put people in a box and say ""ok, that's enough income for you, I know what's best for you and how much you need, to hell with your goals and aspirations in life"". The reason for taxes shouldn't be forced philanthropy, stop this argument please. This is America, the land where we 'try' not to 'force' things on people. Remember? This debate is in the end pointless because the job of the government is to take money from wherever it can, and that is the so-called rich, and trust me Washington doesn't give a crap about the 'fairness' of it in the least.",1
18,"No we should not tax the rich. Many people that are rich went through years of college to become a lawyer or a doctor.

18,"Let's think about this, shall we? You're asking people who have worked hard their entire lives to give up what they have RIGHTFULLY EARNED, to give it to people who simply don't have the ideas, the work ethic, or they're just plain lazy. Sure, their are definitely people who need the money; those people, along with the public works like veterans benefits or the police/fire department are the only ones who should be receiving this money. If you take away the money of rich people, then not nearly as much goes back into the economy. They don't buy things, then those companies they would purchase from go out of business because there is no consumer, which means they lay off workers, and the supplier of the goods has the same problem. it's called a ripple effect. Plus, it's not a foolproof plan even if the rich are taxed more. Taking their money and giving it to someone else isn't going to make that person well off. And making everyone equal, which is the intent, is communism... So let me know how that works out. On top of it all people are saying that rich people are selfish and greedy, when they need to take a look at themselves! They are trying to take other people's money and keep it for themselves!!! They did NOTHING for it! See it from their point of view; imaging that you were super smart, or you had a great idea, or you're just a really hard worker and you put everything you have into your career, which results in a pretty large paycheck. But wait a second- now you have to just give it away? And if you're okay with giving your money away, then good for you. You're generous. But, you can be generous by yourself- DONATE! Don't be forced to give up your money if you don't want to! If before you thought that some people don't work for their money, your partially right. You can inherit it. But, that doesn't apply toward TAXING, because inheritance is generally not taxed., unless it's land. So stop telling people what to do with their money, and go do your own work and earn it yourself. Take some pride in your accomplishments and don't accept handouts. Don't take it; earn it.",1

When the rich saw people who didn't really work hard and earn money make almost as much as them (because if we taxed them is much as you want it'd be about even), they'd soon stop working. Now no one is paying taxes. No one receives money and we're screwed. This is why ""true"" socialism (which is what this would be considered) doesn't work. It seems like a good idea in theory. Sadly reality is much different. You can't make the world perfect and good intentions don't guarantee good decisions.",1

Again, it may be right to tax these people, but it isn't justice; and in the end, justice is what matters most.",1
18,"It makes no sense morally or pragmatically to tax anyone over 40% of what they earn or what they sell and buy-- capital gains tax. Morally speaking, just because someone makes $450,000 a year and can ""afford"" to pay $180,000 in overall taxes, does not make it right. People are allowed to have the fruits of their labors and that does not change whether you make below $25,000 or above $5 Million. While their are some greedy wealthy people, 95% of the population who make $200,000 or more donate to charity. ""The average amount each wealthy household donated to charity in 2011 was $52,770"". So the argument that the wealthy keep it all to themselves is clearly false. Pragmatically, everyone, well nearly everyone, works for what they have. That should be taken into account when taxing the rich and everyone in the US. Also, taxing someone's net worth is by far the worst idea since not allowing women to vote.",1

That's selfish. If I was rich, I'd keep my money because I earned it, I definitely wouldn't give it to some bozo who thinks I should have to pay more taxes because I'm more successful. Everyone has an equal opportunity, and if you don't see that, that's your fault and you're just being arrogant and lazy.",1

I also believe that if someone makes no income maybe they should owe as well, Heck $20 is still $20 million in total tax revenue when recovered from 1 million persons. How is it that the poor get free income from the government (which really isn't the government, as it is coming out of the working taxpayers pockets, which politicians forget apparently where the government's money comes from that they are dishing out) for putting no skin in the game.",1
18,"Why you ask, Why should the wealthy who were successful in life have to pay more. They can donate and do other things to help people but only if they want to. Making them pay more taxes only diseases their initiative to be successful. Why would they try to make more money if they are going to just lose it. They worked for this money. For those people who say why should they live in comfort while people starve that not their fault. Usually the people who are homeless did not listen to their parents and did not take the opportunities given to them and did not work hard enough. Even if your poor you can go to a public school and get a scholarship. So don't tax the upper class for people who don't try to make a living in the first place.",1
18,"I just believe that everyone should pay the same tax PERCENTAGE. If that means that poor people pay 200 to the government in taxes or the rich pay 20,000 in taxes, I believe it doesn't matter as long as everyone pays the same percentage. Just because people are rich doesn't mean they should be punished for it. And I will say it again.....I AM NOWHERE NEAR RICH. But I STILL DON'T believe that is fair to charge the rich a HIGHER percentage then the rest of us.",1
18,"A lot of people these days don't want to work for a living. They like having a government that hands everything to them. Some people have to work harder to get to the top, it's life. there's a reason why most of these people are rich, they worked hard and allocated every resource available to them to get their. Telling someone to pay more in taxes because they have a higher income is preposterous. Who are you to say what my hard earned money should be spent on? I agree that their are people out their that have to work multiple jobs and are less fortunate than others but like I said before, that is life. I would have no problem giving back to the less fortunate, but demanding it is a whole different ball game.",1
18,"The rich already pay more than double the percentage of all income revenues then they make up in the population. Everyone should pay the same percentage of income taxes. I think making the income tax brackets uneven is unfair to people who work hard to make their living. Even middle to low middle class get the short end of the stick,",1
18,"Just because wealthier people have money does not mean they should be taxed higher just because other people don't have the same amount of money. Life isn't supposed to fair, if it was, we would all be in a socialist society, which is where our country is heading if we keep incorporating laws such as Obamacare.",1
18,"I am against whoever says yes. The rich work hard for their money. They create jobs. This is contribution to society. Why should they be punished? They should never be overcharged on tax. Even though the rich make more money than most people. The proportion of tax should be charged reasonably (no more than 20%). 30, 40% that is way more then the reasonable amount.",1
18,Even if we taxed the rich 10% more. That would run the government for 7 days only. That tells me that our government is the problem. Not the rich. The government is doing a good job at making all of you dependent on it and training people to no longer dream and reach for your goals. Blame the rich? I bet they worked their butts off to get where they are.,1
18,"Not that I am anti communism, but unless in a communist country you wouldn't expect it. I believe that everyone should pay the same percentage of tax as that is fair on everyone, it is equal. Wealthy earn more because their occupation pays more. The lower and middle class earn an amount lower for the same reason. If the occupation and/or pay isn't satisfactory you are entitled to quit/look elsewhere.",1
18,"America was designed as a country with minimalist government per our constitution. The Government has gotten too large, and social programs have gotten out of control, therefore increasing the tax burden overall. I believe in a flat tax rate amongst all income levels. For example, a 10% tax rate would mean someone making 1k would pay $100 while someone earning $1,000,000 would pay $100,000. This seems like a more fair representation for all income levels. Having someone at the higher income levels pay close to 40% of their income to taxes while close to half of Americans don't pay anything is not fair. Just because you're ""rich"", should not mean that you should have a higher social responsibility. The government needs to be cut, and so do social programs. Social responsibility should be the responsibility of ALL Americans, not just those who are wealthy.",1
18,"While most people work hard without thinking, the rich get books and improve their diplomacy and knowledge. Thus, they create wealth for the nation and improve the GDP. They don't consume, they create and make profit for going for it! Not being scared of losing all their money. Peace and love and money",1
18,"Everybody is looking for equality in all walks of life yet the want wealth people to lay more. Wealthy people do In fact pay a substantial amount more. But fair would be a flat % from all, even the recipient class, so let's do that and then we can all contribute an equal % of our income.",1
18,"They should not because most of them have worked hard to earn the money that have. The minority have been able to get money passed on from their family but most have still worked and studied hard to get where they are. They shouldn't be taxed more just because they worked harder, and they should be able to keep that money because they earned it.",1
18,"Those who believe that the rich should pay higher taxes are the same school bullies that never grew up! Stop thinking you can get what's not yours for free!

18,"If I make $100000 a year at 10% I pay $10000 if someone else makes $40000 a year at 10% they pay $4000 see the rich still part more but it is a fairly scaled tax rate. The percent should be constant so as to promote personal growth, increase the number of net producers, and still generate income for the government. Why is what I said not enough? Is this so hard to understand?",1
18,"We as a nation should strive for equality. That would mean we all pay an equal (notice that word) percentage of our income. The top 10% already pay 90% of all tax revenue collected. And we want more from them? We should be thanking these fellow Americans. Not punishing them (more). The majority of Americans pay no federal tax at all, in fact some people get tax refunds and never even worked?! This is not equality and we should be ashamed. Everyone should pay the same percentage of their income. When we start separating people to pay more, today's ""the wealthy should pay more"" is tomorrow's ""the blacks should pay more"" or ""He homosexuals should pay more"" or ""the Jews should pay more"" A slippery slope to say the least. How about we practice the equality we preach. Treat everyone the same. That means a flat tax. If everyone thinks the wealthy are cheating and paying nothing, they would be happy with this idea because there are no loopholes and cheats. Everyone pays the same. The fact is the wealthy pay the most already. People are envious and jealous. They covet their neighbors material possessions and wealth. If everyone would mind their own business and focus on themselves the world would be a better place. Don't worry about what others make for a living or how much taxes that pay. it's none of your business.",1
18,"They deserve to have the money they have because they usually are strong characters which have put a lot in in order to be rich - eg. stress, taking risk - feeling cautious. 80% of the people on this planet - the weak characters who only think about tomorrow and have no vision of their future deserve to be trapped in the circle because they most haven't even tried to be successful so they die without knowing if they are capable.",1
18,"First of all, why should anyone pay higher taxes? What will the money be used for? If it's to reduce the national debt, taxing just the rich won't make much of a dent. If it's to help the poor, what makes you think the government can do more to help the poor then what charities do now? Perhaps taxing the rich is simply because of class of envy, in which case the government will have to increase taxes significantly to settle the score. Many suggest that the economy was better when the top tax rate was 90%, but few recognize that little taxes came from that top tier. Few also forget that it was President Kennedy that advocated for a huge reduction in the top tax rates. He did so because the economy in the early 60's needed a boost. If more tax revenue to general is what is needed to fund debt reduction and more government programs, a better solution is to foster an economy where more people are making more money, and everyone is paying more taxes.",1
18,"I'm only 17 and i have started a business (Reznoo) on my own, so right off the bat let's get these ""rich are greedy selfish people that were born into riches"" out of the way. That's immaturity. I have been successful in my business, enough to where my tax rates are higher than the average person. If the rich are so ""selfish"" then what would it be like without them? Well you wouldn't have any big industries which means less jobs and taxes. We would have to tax the middle class more, so much more that they would soon be in the lower class. Is that a smart idea? Because i thought i lived in the country on opportunities, where you have to work hard to be successful? it's upsetting to see that i was born in. The rich uses just as much of the roads, schools, parks, ect. As anybody else, why should they pay more taxes?",1
18,"So yes, the rich will pay more in taxes but not a higher percentage. Someone who makes $1 million/year will pay 100k in income taxes. Someone who makes $50k/year would pay 5k in income taxes. At the same percentage, rich people are paying MUCH more than poor people. What more do you want? Not to mention that most people are rich because of working, saving, and investing all of their lives. Poor people don't think about that stuff until it's too late and they're wondering how they ended up on welfare.",1
18,They should not because it is just unfair. If they are considered wealthy because they work so hard their entire life then that's fine but they shouldn't be charged more. What if they were paying so many expensive taxes that overtime they go back to a lower class. Taxes should all be the same,1
18,"How do you define rich? If you have a high income you could have a highly negative net worth making the bum on the street (who has nothing not the faker) technically richer then you are. Many have gone deep into debt to be able to earn a high net income and have a great deal of student loan debt, but this isn't taken into account. Everyone's situation is different but the beauty of this wonderful country we Americans are so fortunate to live in is that we technically have the opportunity to become rich starting from nothing. Just because you are poor now doesn't mean you always will be, and if and when you make money and have money you should be encouraged to give some away as well as encouraged to enjoy what you have worked hard for. Most do give money away but that is less and less encouraged when we have a government that feels they can give your money away better than you can. The best way to level the playing field in my opinion is to charge a flat sales tax and if rich buy more they pay more tax and same for the poor.",1
18,Rich people are looked at as evil but to be rich you just work hard and look for ways to save money. The ones who want the rich taxed are the ones who spend all their money in stupid places. Think before you spend and don't blame others for your downfalls.,1
18,"As the middle class, we instantly want to shove off some of burden we bear, but the rich are thought of in a stereotype way. Like - ""The butler brings champagne to his sunbathing master"" or the "" we blow our noses on hundred dollar bills."" But not all the rich are born with a silver spoon in their mouths. Some of them are doctors who went through 8 years of medical school and are saving your life in the emergency room, or business men who haven't sleep for three days because their trying to finish the last report. Yes, the middle class suffer too. We toil with no way out, no fat paycheck is waiting for us, but we need to see the rich aren't that different from the fellow man. Sure there's the rich kid who lives off dad's money, but tell me this where did daddy dearest get that money? It could have been passed down the family tree or he could have work his tailbone off. If we tax the rich so that they make the same as us, I believe that isn't fair. If you ask me I would say the government needs to step down on the spending and remember America has yet to have it's great blunder. We are a young country and I think a harsh lesson is on it's way.",1
18,"When our Founding Fathers built this country, they wanted the people to be free and do whatever they wanted. They wanted the people to be free and have little to no government involvement in their lives. Now the government is slowly becoming a Communist and a king. They want to ""Share the wealth"". That's what Russia did in 1917 when they threw the Czar for not treating the people equally. That's when Russia shared the wealth with all the people. Now that's happening to our government today with Welfare and people too lazy to get a job. If something drastic doesn't happen soon, something very bad will happen.",1
18,"When our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they made the citizens to be free. The Founding Fathers wanted to keep the government out of the people's lives as much as they could. However today, The government is slowly becoming a king and slowly going toward Communism. They want to ""Share the death"" like Russia wanted back in 1917 when it was a Communist country. The government keeps ignoring the Declaration of Independence and it's starting to show",1
18,"By taxing people even more, you are basically taking away the incentive of innovation/hard work. More people will realize that it is useless to work so hard. Why work so hard, when government will take pretty much half of it? It is just sad to see that America will turn out to be capitalist, and most of the innovative man will take away their money, and invest it to other country.",1
18,"America is based on equality so I believe everyone should pay equal taxes. But at a rate where it's not an economic hardship on the taxpayers but a fair amount to support the government. I am at a true loss for how my fellow Americans justify taxing the rich at a higher rate then the middle and lower classes. The common argument, of course, is that the wealthy have more money, thus can afford a higher tax rate. Duh. Bill Gates can afford a 99% tax rate if necessary, but it's the ideal that counts. Consider this logic before throwing bunk arguments my way: America is a Capitalist country. Capitalism encourages financial success. Thus an American who is wealthy has succeeded at the 'American Dream.' So why punish those who have succeeded? Doesn't that seem counterintuitive to you? To me, taxing the rich at an astronomical rate while taxing the poor at an astronomically small rate actually hinders the desire to be successful. To be clear, I don't believe in income taxation whatsoever, however if we must collect tax, we shall collect at an equal rate, ie., Flat Tax. To do otherwise is an impediment upon our individual freedoms, rich and poor alike. America is built upon the values of equal opportunities, and tax brackets are most certainly not equal.",1
18,"Yes the rich are fortunate to be rich. However, the rich already pay most of the taxes in this country. 47% of people don't even pay taxes!! Stop feeling sorry for ourselves and start contributing to your country. ""Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."" If everyone was able to pay their share of taxes, maybe then just maybe, taxes will be lower. But no, the only solution Democrats see is TAX THE RICH! Help the rich grow in their field so they can give people who are poor full time jobs, so they can do something productive for the nation, themselves, and their families. If you have a good job you can pay taxes, and once everyone pulls their share of taxes, the nation as a whole will not have high tax rates. However, taxes should based off the percent of income that an individual makes, so yes, the rich will still be paying their share of taxes, more than the average joe, but not a higher percentage then the average joe. So for an example, an average joe they will pay $6 out of $100 income while a rich guy would pay $60 out of their $1,000 income at a 6% income tax rate.",1

They are not guaranteed you in any part of the Constitution or the American Dream. You are simply granted a chance. Most people don't want to try, my school being a great example. their are all kinds of kids who claim smarts, you just can't prove it on paper. Arising from the issue that trying to hard in school will lead to a rough time, while it also poses a risk of failure. It has been shown that mindset has a lot to with success in school. A while back a read an article about men and women who took a test on math and English; when told the test was a measure of their intelligence, the women did worse on the math and better on the English, but when they were told the test was just a prep, and therefore in their eyes inconsequential, the sexes scored about the exact same. Intelligence is all a matter of perspective, a drive toward some dream or goal and hard work are the real keys to success.",1

And guess what!? Not everyone who makes a million dollars or more a year is a no-good sly businessman who mooches off of other people's hard work. They're innovators, high-end doctors researching cures for cancer. Inventors who came up with an idea to fill a need and pursued it. Why should they be ""punished"" and robbed of their riches, that just so happened to come along with their works? So in conclusion, people who think they ""deserve"" money for nothing are the real nuisances to our country. Putting rich people down won't make you any better. We pay 90% of the country's income taxes. Why should we pay even more to cover up for your debts and welfare?",1
18,"What if you became wealthy? This country was founded on the principles to pursue happiness and one of those avenues is through wealth. Otherwise, it will be headed towards communism. Wealth is an earned privilege not a right. Some people earn their wealth because they are strong. Others because they are are beautiful, and others because they are smart enough to do it. Those who are neither of those categories are needed to provide services are laborers. We need workers. I am a worker but I am putting my money where it makes me money. it's worth the risk and if my plan doesn't work, I'll just make another one. I don't hate the rich, I want to know what they did to get their. Just the process alone makes me happy. When I have my wealth, I am not going to pay taxes for it, that's what the working class is their for. I, like those who favor wealth, exist to make myself happy not a bunch of crybabies who want a socialist government and none of you are going to stop me.",1
18,"The rich won't like it. The taxes are already way way way too high and it will not have much a difference. So no we, the rich, shouldn't be forced to pay more than the other people. The rich people should be treated fairly like everyone else, no matter how much they make",1
18,"I find it slightly disturbing that people would want to increase the tax rate on those who create jobs. Do the very wealthy make more money? Yes. Should they have to pay more because they're making more money? No. As long as they are earning money legally, why should they have to pay a higher rate then someone, in the same legal system, who is not taking advantage of his or her opportunities? The claim that the working poor or that the middle class work harder than the upper class is absolutely ridiculous. All three classes work hard, but they their jobs are hard in unique ways. If someone is in the working poor class and cannot shift to the middle class and further up, then that person is doing something incorrectly or has don't something incorrectly that is prohibiting his or her shift upwards. Why should the upper class pay for someone else's mistakes? I am most definitely in favor of a consumption tax. If a person consumes more, then he or she should pay more. If I send my child to a private school, why do I need to pay into the public education system? I do think that every citizen should be taxed for the military, public infrastructure, and politicians' salaries because everyone uses these entities one way or another.",1
18,"Everyone receives similar benefits from the governments. Someone who pays 1 billion in taxes and someone who pays 5,0oo in taxes are treated as equal. If both people get the same out of it the rich should put the same in to it. Just because someone has more money does not mean people who have less money are entitled to their help. I'm not even rich and I believe this is true. If someone who earns 30,000 a year pays 5,000 a year then someone who earns a billion a year should earn the same. The government does not give billionaires more therefore the billionaires should not be forced to give more. It doesn't matter if people with small incomes have it hard, it's still the the responsibility of the rich to take that burden off of them. Billionaires are not responsible to give away billionaires to make it easy for everybody else.",1

18,"Private sector is so much more efficient with money then government is and they know how to use it. If we gave them more money/cut taxes they would use it well and create more money and more jobs. If they have more taxes they will hurt and keep employment down.

18,"Almost everyone in the world wants to be wealthy. They want a comfortable lifestyle, and the ability to successfully take good care of their family. Other may simply want to live in a life of luxury. However, how they got rich doesn't matter. The fact is that the rich most likely worked for it. They put forth blood, sweat, and tears into what they did, so they should be able to bask in their reward; wealth. Taxing one group of people (the rich) more than another (the not rich) is un-American. We live in a country based on EQUALITY. Everyone should have an equal right to keep what they earn. Even if people today don't believe that's the case, our very own Founding Fathers did. Samuel Adams, a Founding Father, even declared that taxing the rich more would be an UNCONSTITUTIONAL act in America. George Washington believed in laissez-faire capitalism. Also, it goes against the Constitution's fifth amendment, because taxing another group of people more then the other involves taking away property (money) from someone against their will, and the excessively-taxed rich aren't getting compensated for it.",1

18,"I believe that the idea of rich people paying more taxes than poor people is horrible. Many people would argue that, because they are rich, they can afford to pay more, but it is money well-earned that the government is taking away from them. If the rich and the poor pay the same percentage, it would be much more JUST. It would not be fair, but that is okay because no one gets the same opportunities as someone else. JUSTICE means to give and take what is earned. The government is taking more money from the rich then they are from the poor just because they CAN, not because that's what's RIGHT. Now, this does not mean that I believe that the government should issue an exact dollar amount for everyone to pay. If they did that, either the poor people would not afford it, or the poor would be able to afford it, but the government would not have enough taxes to support themselves or our Armed Forces. I believe that the government should issue an equal percentage for both the rich and the poor to pay. To illustrate this principle, I will give an example that is applicable, but will not happen in real life. Let's say that a wealthy person makes $100 a week and a poor person makes $10 a week. At the end of ten weeks, they both pay their taxes. If they both have to pay the same dollar amount, say it is $50, then the poor person would only have $50 left because the government took the other half, and this poor person would not be able to support him/herself. However, if this government has issued a percentage, say it is 30%, then the poor person has enough to support himself. 30% of $100 is $30. 30% of $1000 is $300, so both the wealthy and the poor person still have enough money to support themselves. :)",1

Taxes should work the same way, each upper class person contributes far more than the lower class people even with the current tax rates, and that's already more than enough. The lower class needs to get off it's butt and stop taking money from the upper class, which contrary to popular belief, does work for its money, and doesn't just pull it straight from the lower class' pockets.",1

Second, you earn what you work for. They worked for it. They get to keep it. Third and most important, taxes go to pay for services the government provides the citizens the people allow it to govern. The rich don't get better services from the government then anyone else, yet they use the same infrastructural and benefits the government provides. It is wrong to have to pay more because you can, to receive nothing more. The money the government sucks out of successful people could be used by the successful individuals to expand their companies, put more people into good jobs and so on. The system is wrong. Either a fixed percentage or a flat fee no matter your salary should be how taxes work. The founding fathers would be appalled at what the taxes are today, when they worked so hard to get away from England's tax stranglehold. Just to put this in perspective, I am a student who makes very little per year and these are still my beliefs.",1
18,"Saying that the rich should be taxed more is like saying that just because I have straight As and my sister has straight Cs that I should be banned from turning in homework and doing my work so that we can be equal. No, that doesn't make sense. If that is the case then no one would try to be better. I know if that was the case I wouldn't try to be better than anyone, ever. there would be no point. If a person is so obsessed with equality then living in America is a bad choice. Go to a communist country. Who ever told you people that life was fair, lied. Nothing will ever be equal so live with it. Work hard and you could possibly become rich and I guarantee that your opinion will change. I am not rich by any means, but I am not doing poorly and letting my life pass me by either.",1
18,"If I make 50,000 and pay 30% that's fine, (it's way to much but that's another story) Why should someone making $1,000,000 pay more than %30? How would that be ""fair taxes"" that's stupid and does nothing but punish success. If I ever work hard enough to be a millionaire, I damn sure want it to be my money.",1
18,"Life was never meant to be fair, sometimes you are born into a better family then others, or sometimes born rich, but that doesn't mean if you are poor, you are poor forever. You just need to work for the money. I came from a very poor family in China, only a select 100 was chosen each year to go to college with full scholarship. I worked hard everyday, and was the top in my class. I worked hard to be number one in my school. I made it into college and was able to move here to America because I was educated enough to find a job to work at here. Now I make enough to live a happy lifestyle. I send money to my family in China every month to support them. I don't understand why other people can't work hard. If you grow up without trying, that is your problem. We already give billions of dollars to the lower working class.",1
18,"Just because they make a lot of money doesn't mean they have to give it away to the government to waste on stupid programs. They have worked a lot harder then those who don't make much. How do you think they became rich? Most people don't just inherit all their money; they have to work for it. Those who are now rich are the ones who studied and went to college so they could get tons of degrees whereas a large population of the poor have never finished high school so they have to get terrible jobs because they didn't care. If the rich are taxed more their will also be unintended consequences. If they are taxed less they will have more money to spend on things, which gives the poor a job and something to work for, like million dollar homes and fancy clothes or just junk for around their house. They are the foundation for our economy. They spend all the money so they are providing the jobs. But, if we raise taxes we will destroy America. The government will spend more money or welfare and other government handouts. They are providing thousands of dollars of aid to people who don't even work. They will never have worked and never will work. They don't even know want to work; they just expect the government to give them money. So, picture this: if the rich Americans suddenly left what would happen to the American economy. It would completely die. there would be no one providing the government with money to waste in Pakistan fighting over nothing or educate children who don't want to be educated. their would also be so much less money to spend on welfare. The poor would be screwed because no one would be their to pay for them so keep the rich in America by not taxing them as much. We should totally get rid of the tax bracket! Everyone should have to pay their fair share (If they make $10 billion they should pay $1 billion and if someone else makes $10 they should pay $1) but no one should have to pay a larger portion of their taxes and before someone says anything like ""but higher taxes won't hurt the rich guy as much,"" why do you have to hurt the rich guy? They just paid a billion dollars. You should watch Dr. Carson at the Prayer Breakfast. And if everyone pays an equal amount then ALL people will feel the pain of a tax raise so maybe then Americans will decide that maybe it isn't a good idea to waste a trillion dollars a year trying to conquer the Middle East. Then rich won't be the only people complaining of stupid government spending. SO THE RICH SHOULDN'T BE TAXED MORE, THEY SHOULD EVEN BE TAXED LESS!!!",1
18,"When taxes are raised on the rich, it eats up capital and makes doing business in this country less profitable. Higher taxes combined with suffocating regulations drive people out of business, and also drive businesses out of the country. Instead, we should make politicians accountable and enact some serious austerity measures. This country is seriously in need of some slimming down.",1
18,"The rich should actually get a tax break because they are contributing so much money. If I worked hard to be rich, went to school, came out with student loans, and years of training - why should I have to pay a higher percentage as someone making half of what I make? The rich are putting a lot of money into the system already, why add on more tax? It is their property. Think about it. A guy makes $100. The government takes 10% - guy=$90 (government =$10) | Guy 2 makes 10,000 - government take 10% - guy= $9,000 | (government=$1,000). Who isn't doing his fair share? Government caters to people who don't even look for a job, but if you make a good amount of money and you are rich, it will steal more money in taxes from you, ""cause it won't hurt"". What a great American Dream. The government will want more and more of your stuff as you get more stuff.",1
18,"Most rich people just have a really good job, because they worked hard in school, and their job is tough so they get paid more. They work their butt off, and why should they get penalized? I understand that poor people don't have enough money to pay as much as rich people do, but why can't rich people pay the same amount as poor people do?",1
18,"When the president vilifies a group of loyal law abiding legal Americans for not ""paying their fair share"" when all but the ultra rich work hard and pay ""regular"" not ""capital gain"" based taxes including ATM he is fueling the most vile kind of class warfare and harm that comes through mob or act of government to that class of successful Americans. Giving the angry majority of the country a reason to act out their hostility on one class of society is as wrong as white's acting out against blacks for getting affirmative action benefits.",1
18,"How would you like to work hard all your life to finally make a good amount of money to enjoy the remainder of your life on, only to have your hard-worked, honest money be taken away from you? Guess who it's given to. Someone on welfare that doesn't work and contribute to society. Nobody would want their money taken away, so don't say we should take away from the rich, because I know you wouldn't want your money to be taken away and given to someone undeserving of it.",1
18,"First off, I attend high school and college, work a minimum wage job and I pay all of my bills. I don't think they should have a higher tax rate then any one of us, because the vast majority (all of them) don't use EBT WIC or Medicare and don't spend our tax money on themselves. If you thought politicians were wasteful, you should see people lying on their forms for more of the governments funds. The only real answer is to cut the government's spending down to the bare necessities to keep the government and the real ""unfortunate"" people alive.",1
18,"Obviously they worked harder to become millionaires so why should a higher class pay more? Let me think to pay low class people to live. I'm middle class just saying, if I worked hard went to college and became a doctor and had to pay more tax to save a man's life I would be pissed.",1
18,"Why does someone who makes $1,000,000 pay more than someone who makes $100,000 a year? Because they work harder? Well they worked for it. They don't need to give lots of it away for being successful. Especially for those whom do nothing and let the money come on in. The rich already give money to the government. If I were to pay 15% of 1,000,000, it would be 150,000. Plenty of money isn't it? Democrats aren't making the economy better in the right way, they need to limit their spending on giving to other countries.",1
18,"Everybody in this world should be equal. Knowing that in the United States declaration says that all men are created equal why would the rich pay more than others in taxes? When will this society be equal again? Right now even if we took all the wealthy people's money we would only have half of this years debt paid. So to sum it up, no the rich shouldn't pay more.",1
18,"A flat tax rate is preferable to a progressive system. Increasing taxes can reach a tipping point when there are no longer adequate incentives for an individual to innovate or work harder. The country we know was built by innovators, without proper incentives the economy and the standard of living stagnates. Solution: Cut wasteful spending",1
18,"The proposed increase of tax among rich has a good intention that would benefit the public, but that would not be practical, worse, it could be dangerous. Businesses will leave the country, as a result many people will lose their job. When almost all the businesses are gone, the economy will fall that would result to widespread poverty.",1
18,We shouldn't tax the rich more because they earn that money fairly like most people. Even if you don't tax them more they will still pay far more in taxes than you because of their money. How would you like it if you made a billion dollars and bought a ton of stuff and then get taxed into debt?,1
18,Rich people shouldn't pay more taxes and the only reason people believe that higher taxes solve problems is because they've been sold that ideal since birth. Higher taxes don't solve problems because business moves faster then government which is the main reason why there are government loopholes. Unless the idea is for our capitalistic government to become a communist government higher taxes make absolutely no sense. Higher taxes will make everyone poorer instead government's role should be to enforce better business practices meaning higher penalties on business that undermine government laws.,1
18,"Yes, it is true that the gap between the rich and the poor will increase. The rich gets richer, the poor get poorer. But what good would it do to tax the upper class? Yes, the US may expect greater tax returns but that will only be temporary. Would you want to say in the US if your earnings were constantly being taken away in taxes. The incentive to work would be lost, jobs would be cut, or the company may relocate to a different country. Without jobs, people would not be able to spend, If people don't spend, the economy would stay at a standstill. In addition, doesn't taxing the rich remind us of the theory of socialism? According to Karl Marx, to create a true Utopian society, everyone in the society must be equal in all aspects of life. But we have seen numerous times that societies attempting to undergo socialism or communism have utterly failed in the process. The system is a great system, but Karl Marx failed to realize the true nature of people. A system that distributes equally to all is bound to fail. If you were a chief administrator faced with the duty of sending 50 billion dollars to the people, would you truly send all of that money, or possibly keep some to yourself? This is not just a hypothetical question, it is ongoing in the world today! WE CANNOT make the rich pay higher taxes. If you look at the situation in a long-term aspect, society is bound to collapse. Now, the opponent is right about the inequality that occurs between the rich and the poor. But that is all something that is up to ourselves. Many organizations and corporations engage in illegal practices, but to coexist, we must get rid of such practices. But as we have seen in human behavior, since the times of Adam and Eve, this is not possible. Therefore, the rich should not be forced to pay higher taxes.",1
18,"Why don't we all pay same percentage of tax? In this case, everyone who wants more money has to work harder. So no more lazy bums! I am sick of paying for everyone while they are still crying for we are not paying enough. How about everyone share the tax?",1
18,"Call me selfish, but I've worked my arse off to get to where I am. Why should I pay more? We all have equal opportunities. it's not my fault that I utilized it where others didn't. it's not my fault that I strove to get through the amount of schooling that I did. Even at greater income levels come great responsibilities. As a doctor, I pay a lot for malpractice insurance. I put my license at risk any time I treat someone. I deserve my income because I've simply earned it. I have more at risk. And I did not work through years of more schooling so that I can pay higher taxes.",1
18,"No, they shouldn't. The only way they got wealthy was from hard earned money from years of work. How would you feel if you were wealthy and they announced ""Oh, now we will be charging rich people more because we can."" How would you feel? How do you think they earned the money? The government handed it to them? They found it on the street? Some random person said ""Oh hey here's $50,000.00 I don't want it anymore""? NO! They earned it from a well paying job, which anyone can get.",1
18,"The rich create jobs by spending money. The more money the rich have, the more jobs they can create. All money that rich people earn is either invested or spend. This stimulates the economy, thus creating jobs. Why should the government take money from people who earned it and can create jobs themselves just to spent that money inefficiently, supposedly to reach the same ends? Even though the rich can pay more taxes, if they do, it actually serves only to hurt the economy, since they are the ones that create jobs.",1
18,"Everyone should pay the same percentage regardless of wages. What motivation do people have to succeed if you are going to increase the percentage they pay into the system the more they succeed? I started my company by borrowing $400. Sold the merchandise, took the profits and bought more merchandise. I did this over and over again. In 10 years, I have 40 employees. That's 40 more jobs that I created! But because they tax my inventory sitting in my stores, I am suddenly the top 2%? I got paid $50,000 last year from my business but yet I owe $450,000 in federal income taxes! I am so sick of being taxed! We are even having a hard time sending our oldest to a state college! But I am in the top ""wealthiest"" Americans? If we are all truly supposed to be equal, equal rights, equal everything...then we should all pay the same equal percentage of taxes regardless if you make $5,000 or $50 billion. Our country needs to stop discriminating against people who have worked their tails off to become successful.",1
18,"Taxing the rich makes very little difference in solving this country's problems. It does not produce enough money. More revenue for the government is not the answer. They have more than they need already. The solution is to stop spending. They should not pick and choose what to cut. They should suspend all spending and cut every program at the same percentage rate until the budget is balanced. Next, pass a constitutional amendment to repeat this process every year should the budget go over the limit again. New programs would require 75% of the congressional vote to pass. This would require both parties participation in the bill regardless of who is in power. The rich (top 5%) already pay more tax than 50% of the rest of us (the poor) according to the IRS. It may make you feel better but it will not put another dime in your pocket. Quit whining and get busy.",1
18,"I like the well to do--they have kept me working for 35 years now. I have never had a ""poor"" person give me a job. Cut off the entitlement programs. No I am not rich but I do know that every time my pay goes up so does my taxes, so I can only imagine what they are paying.",1
18,"You see, the rich people are only rich because they pay for their money, I'm rich, and I believe that I have the right to keep my money. If you pay for the poor, it unbalances the whole system, just think about it. If the top 2% of the United States pays for the lowest 10%, then the 10% goes up and a new 10% enters the bottom, and eventually the rich become even poorer, and the whole system is totally thrown off.",1
18,"The rich work hard to earn money, why should they pay? I mean, seriously, would you want to pay more, forced? I certainly wouldn't.

18,"I am so tired of working for the Government; I did not make this mess! They did. But we the tax slaves always have to pay for their spending. The fight over raising taxes on the rich is only a push off not to cut spending on Government. If the government was not so controlling over us or so big as they are we would not be taxed as much.

18,"I almost feel as if I am being asked to apologize to people around me for the success my family has experienced. My husband and I married at 26 and started off our lives together in a small apartment. I am a teacher/coach and my husband started his career at a small, local energy company in Oklahoma. Through the next 10 years we had two children and moved 7 times, all to places where we didn't know anyone. My husband traveled 3 weeks out of the month, sometimes over a weekend, which meant a really long and painful weekend. We ate more than our share of pizza pockets, chicken nuggets and mac-n-cheese in those days because that is what you do when you are on a tight budget. We didn't have extra's back then, but we both put our heads down worked hard because we knew that each day brought us closer to our ""better days"". We made sacrifices that were tough to take, like being away from parents when they were sick, taking your child to daycare when they are screaming that they don't want to go, not going to movies, not even being able to have time away to grab some sanity because there is no one to call to give you a break and no money to pay them with anyway I know I don't need to go on, you get the picture. Now after 25 years of marriage, we are in the oven $250,000 a year who will face this new tax increase. We have debt we owe, college bills to pay, (since we don't qualify for any type of financial assistance), medical bills yet now we are being asked to pay almost half of what we earn, before we meet those debt obligations, to the government. I'm sorry, I am not willing to give up what we have earned for our family so the government, which already works so well, can continue to do exactly what it has been doing with the funds they already manage. I am not going to apologize for our hard work and quality jobs. I am sick of people out thinking that people who make over $250,000 are rich it's all relative. I am all for paying taxes, but this is ridiculous!!",1

It will end up when their will be no rich but all going to be poor, like in Cuba, North Korea or used to be in former USSR.",1
18,"One of the ten principles of economics is that people respond to incentives. If you take away people's incentive to get rich by taxing them more for earning more money, the incentive to the population is to *not* get rich.

18,"It is discouraging to move up into a new tax bracket because you are earning more money. This can honestly discourage small businesses and people alike. Many of the ""wealthy people"" paying money are entrepreneurs trying to manage a business. They end up being hurt. I believe in a flat tax. If all of our taxes vested solely in a sales tax many of these debates would be eliminated. The rich would pay more simply because they would buy more products and the poor would pay less because they would buy less. No one would have tax taken out of their income, so everyone would feel they had more freedom to spend their money on what they need most.",1

It’s not the rich people's fault you aren't rich too. They have earned it and should enjoy it. If you think they should be taxed more it is just pure jealousy because you couldn't (or are too lazy) to get work hard enough to get rich yourself.",1

Uh, what does that have to do with it? The people that are successful are being penalized for their success? How is that fair? Like Ryan said in the debate, even if you collected 100% of the taxes from the top earners in America, it would only run the government for 98 days! The bottom line here is, we have to cut spending and unfortunately that means we have to cut programs. The sad truth is, we are spending more than we are taking in. People know this to be a problem. If you as a family are going out to eat and going to the movies and going on vacation and it's costing you more money then your making.... how long would it be before you stopped and said,""We need to stop, we have rent/mortgage, utilities, care insurance, gas, etc"".... you know, all the ""Needs"" and none of the ""Wants."" You have to cut back so you can make ends meet. This is just basic economics. How much would a bank let you borrow before they said, hey wait a minute, this guy is spending more than he makes, we will never see our money back.... This is exactly what the world market is seeing just on a larger scale. The country needs to change course, and fast.",1
18,"I believe the rich somewhat deserve their money. Someone in their family made the money (lottery, scamming, stocks, oil, whatever), so that family should keep that money. While this will create the typical unbearable rich kid, someone in their family worked to earn that money. How would you like it if someone took away the money you made for your descendants (children) and gave it to someone else? Specifically about the taxes, I support a linear tax system (as in, everyone pays 20% in taxes). To me, it is the most fair and equal system and doesn't change as you go up. there are two opposing views I would like to address before I end. 1. People say that the rich don't need much money to stay alive, so they can afford higher taxes. The problem with this is that lifestyle is all relative. I am willing to bet that you (the reader) have stuff you don't depend upon to survive (care, books, phone, TV, computer, chairs, non-food producing plants...),. Therefore, you have extra money to spend, and can be taxed more. You don't need a $45,000 income when $5000 would do fine. 2. Some people say that the rich are lazy. For some of the rich, I would agree (cough*Paris Hilton*cough). But others I would disagree. Your typical millionaire doesn't live in a mansion, but in a mid-size house. They worked and saved up that money. I don't want to get repetitive, but the thing I said about kids applies here too. Well, that is my opinion. I hope it makes sense to all of you.",1
18,Rich people became rich because they are very hard working and entrepreneurial. They create jobs. They drive the economy.

18,"Public education, roads, defense. If someone makes >250k, are they using these public goods more then someone making less money? Absolutely not. In response to Knights Of The 9, if rich people saved their money to become millionaires, what in the world is wrong with that? it's ridiculous that the mindset of people now is that being successful and earning money makes you bad. Obama CANNOT relate to you. If you think he can, he made $1.7 Million last year, and his net worth is ~$12 million. Romney has created jobs, and doesn't involve raising taxes on the rich. One other point: if you increase taxes on people as they earn more money, they are less apt to pay taxes and more apt to find ways out of paying taxes. Maybe we should try a regressive tax-as you make more money, you pay at a lower marginal tax rate. That would get people motivated to work and earn.",1
18,"Why should the government discriminate against who should pay how much? What did a rich person do to you for you to deserve a greater percentage of their money? The government should tax everyone equally. Every argument about job creation, or hard work is a nice way to think about it, but irrelevant. The government should not unfairly burden one class over another.",1
18,"The rich are the people who are creating 99% of the jobs in America using their disposable income. If it is not for starting a new business or expanding their current one(s), then it is invested into the stock market or spent, which drives the economy. The rich would already pay a lot more than the poor would if the percentage of income was the same, and it is simply not fair for them to be taxed more. Despite what some of my opponents are saying, that the rich didn't work for their money, people who are rich worked extremely hard for their money, and if they didn't someone in their family did before them. We as Americans don't have the right to take what is not ours, and why would you when it will ultimately hurt you long run? The economy is in the rut that it is in today because of this socialistic non-sense and Obamanomics that the president has been trying to instill upon us is the right thing. America, if we punish people for doing well, what is the incentive to innovate? Private enterprise always can do a better job that the government because of competition, and of we eliminate the incentive to do well, then we will ultimately decline in quality of life, healthcare, innovation, and job creation.",1
18,"Rich people usually make their money by owning companies which means that they hire people and are providing jobs.

18,"there is one big misconception here. The income of the wealthy is not just one big slush fund that we can tax money out of while doing no harm. This money from the wealthy is invested in the stock market, consumption, and used in expanding their businesses. All these measures are either investments which expand businesses and thus employ more workers and at higher wages, or this money is used in consumption which employs workers elsewhere. These job creators drive the economy forward. Lower taxes at fair rates (say, a flat tax) would level the playing field of competing businesses, and grow the economy. Increasing taxes will slow the economy, and provide more money for government, which will not likely be used for deficit reduction.",1
18,"Flat tax, 15%. Don't punish those that work harder. I'm not rich but I have the common sense to know what will work in the country and what won't. Taking away the incentive for people to work harder by taxing them more is a horrible idea. Don't bite the hand that feeds you.",1
18,"Technically, if really poor people were taxed at 100%, and really rich people were taxed at 1%, their would probably be a huge inequality in that the rich people would likely still be paying more than the poor. So it's already unequal in that the same percentages for people with different incomes cause significant differences in the quantity paid. Since rich people usually have a greater investment in the country, I think making everyone pay the same percent is reasonable (even if absolute taxes were higher on the rich), but I think making certain people pay higher percents AND higher absolutes is just stupid.",1
18,"Jealousy is an awful thing. their is and always will be the ""haves"" and ""have nots"" in this world. We all enjoy watching and reading about the lifestyles of the rich and famous. It is easy to be envious of people living in huge mansions, flying off to exotic places in their private jets. Most of us can only dream of this life style. However, many of of continue to strive and work to achieve some portion of this life style. The only chance for the largest percent of the population to achieve some assemblance of this dream is to have a booming, vibrant economy, offering the most number of people good paying jobs. Most rich people have worked hard or came up with some innovative idea and were rewarded for their work and risk taking. This is capitalism, the most successful economic model in the history of the world. This is not to say that some rich people are not paying their share, because their will always be people who will try to cheat the system. But most rich people do pay their share. I feel it is a dangerous precedent to say tax increases for the rich will help the poor. Afterall, as some poor people achieve success, they will move up the economic ladder to the middle or even upper class, then only to pay more and more taxes. This in turn will tend to hold them down; to sort of ""lock them in"" the class where you are presently at. This destroys all incentive to keep working, producing and innovating. The final result is less job production with a shrinking economy. The is is where we are at now. No-one works without being rewarded, rich, poor or otherwise. So what is fair? Perhaps a flat percentage rate or a national sales tax. But, implementing some return to the 50 - 90 % marginal tax rates of old on the richest Americans will only stifle investment and risk taking, thus destroying jobs and further shrinking our economy. The ones that will suffer, not the rich, but the very people we have been trying to help-the poor.",1
18,We are all in this mess together and in order to get out we are all going to have to make some changes. No matter how much you make everyone should pay the same percentage in taxes so that way it is equal. The rich may pay more money but they also make more money. Also in making all tax percentages the same this allows the rich to spend money and put it back into the economy. :),1
18,"there should be a flat tax across the board on anyone over 30k. Say 15%. Then everyone knows exactly what they take home in pay. And get rid of the loop holes, tax credits and write offs. Then take all those IRS agents and have them investigate all the waste fraud and abuse in all the entitlement programs. But in actuality according to our Constitution no one should be paying any Federal Income Taxes.",1
18,"Therefore they should pay the same tax rate. I don't propose that they don't pay more money, after all, they earn more. However, the perspective that a person should pay a higher rate then another is unjust in that it infringes on the personal freedom of an individual. As opposed to burdening individual citizens with more strenuous expenses, let's instead rewrite the government's spending so that everyone can enjoy a strong education system and be competent to further themselves towards their own ambitions.",1
18,"Fact: no one family was rich from the beginning. their was always one with an ambition that EARNED that money and found a way to hold on to it. He fought and made his way to the top. You can't be rich from doing absolutely nothing. Yet out their in America today... are people who abuse the systems of our nation. Using welfare as an excuse to never work again. PEOPLE like THAT are killing the system, not the oh so evil rich people who create jobs and build up a foundation so that others may become profitable too. I'm not preaching all this because I am rich, because I am not... but I plan to be... I rather it still be worthwhile to get their when I do... Do you plan to NEED help from the rich, pro side?",1
18,"Civil Rights proponents are all about making everyone equal, EXCEPT during tax season. I do feel that 90% of the current loopholes should abolished. The government should prop up a set rate of 9% across the board with ZERO deductions regardless of who you are or what you make. Fair is Fair",1

They would also leave this country a bit dumber to. Go Ahead kill the golden goose.",1
18,"Why should I be required to pay more taxes because I happen to make more money? Percentages are equal for everyone, so if I make a million dollars and have to pay 20% for taxes then it is equally difficult for me as it is for the person who makes ten thousand dollars. What matters is how the money is put to use, since we want to overspend in the government we are always looking for ways to finance that overspending and people too often think that it is right to just take more from the rich. However, the rich are often the ones that are providing more of the money that valuable charities need to survive and thrive, these charities are more important than government imposed services because they are funded by choice, not by force. So take money from everyone equally, or even better don't take money from anyone at all.",1
18,No I disagree that a rich person should pay more taxes in US as the person has reached a stage where he/she can lead a luxurious life because of sheer hard work and dedication. So it should be equal for everybody.,1
18,"No, I don't think the rich should pay higher taxes in the US because they already pay a lot higher percentage of their incomes than any other wage earning group. If the rich have less money to spend, their will be fewer jobs because the rich spend money, and create jobs. By the way, a poor person has never hired me for a job.",1
18,People who are rich is because of the hard work they put in to earn the money they. A middle class person had the same opportunity to become rich. The rich had better ideas. If the rich pay higher taxes then they will have less money. Less money means less spending. They will cut back on luxury spending and put those companies that cater to the rich out of business. It will have a domino effect. The rich are business owners and will stop hiring people because they have less money. We need the rich to keep investing their money. I'm a middle class person and I need the rich to keep their money.,1
18,"Most of the time the ""rich"" are the ones who work more than one job and do overtime and save their money while the ""poor"" are lazy mooches on welfare who take a check every month for absolutely no work. Do you honestly think it's fair to take earnings from a hard working person who's trying to provide for their family while the lazy poor one is lazy and does nothing but make babies for the rest of us to pay for? Every man should make his own fortune, someone who happens to be more financially successful should not have to make up for one who's not. He who will do no work shall not eat",1
18,"Two points: 1 - lower my taxes and I will put more money into the economy by hiring people and buying goods and services. Take it from me as taxes and it will eventually trickle down to help someone in the from of an entitlement or a government job. The question is whether you want a bureaucracy of lifetime employees to intervene between the money and the people who want it. 2 - let's say you pay 100 fold more federal tax then the average taxpayer in the USA. Do you use, overall, 100 fold more resources? You could argue that in the from of defense, yes since national defense protects your larger assets. But, what about entitlements (social security or Medicare). Someone in my income bracket has no need for either, we provide for our own retirement and health care. So, what is really ""fail?"" Share. How many fold greater should the wealthy pay to cover those that can't? 100 fold? Why not 1000 fold? Why not have everyone just take home 50k net income whether you actually make nothing or 10m? What would be my incentive to try to make 10m in that case? Why not just stay home and take the 50k handout?",1
18,"there are many uses for that money, more than 20% of the USA's money belongs to the rich(1% of the population). That money has many more uses that for their leisure. Many are in the streets in poverty while the rich make money. Do the rich need all this money? No. Some may ask, do we have the right to take off the rich, yes! They took money off us. With flat tax, everyone has to pay an equal amount, it suits the rich, but many will not be able to afford it. Progressive tax is much better. It allows everyone to be taxed according to their income. Much fairer!",-1
18,"You are referring to the idea of a progressive income tax, meaning tax rates increase as a person's income increases. This is the tax system utilized by almost all developed countries, and for good reason. The moral justification of the rich being obligated to give back more to society lies in the fact that generally, the rich have taken more from society. While individual effort is no doubt a significant aspect of a person's ability to amass wealth, their are background factors which play a much larger role. Economic exchange, the route to wealth, is only possible due to a strong community and economy. In a ravaged, third world country, a man could work as hard as any other, but still fail to become as prosperous because they suffer from a lack of advantages such as inadequate education, fewer economic connections, etc. Even here in America, your capability to get richer then the next guy is in part influenced by an upper hand you have been given at some point in your life, one you may not even see or understand. Therefore, we can assume that to some degree, those who achieve have benefited from these advantages that the poor have not. Thus, it makes sense that they should carry a greater responsibility to contribute to society.",-1
18,"We need to tax the rich more because it is one of the sure ways that we can put our economy back onto a stable and sound path. Republicans constantly bash liberal ideas for not working logically on paper. Since most of their economic policies fail, their only argument is that liberal systems may not work in theory. What most people don't realize is their is a huge difference between what works on paper and what happens in real life. On paper, it doesn't look right to tax certain people more, but in real life, it works, affluent people still have tons of money to spare, and at the same time, small businesses bloom, jobs skyrocket, people are confident enough to invest in the stock market, and the government can pay off its debts and move in a forward, rather then backward direction.",-1
18,"Everyone says that the rich worked hard for their money and shouldn't have to pay more. So does that mean they are saying that the lower class people aren't working just as hard, if not harder? Last time I checked, a film star pushed into cereal commercials as a child who somehow magically climbed the later without even bothering to go to college and try to earn a degree or whatever the heck it is didn't work nearly as hard as the first generation college graduate who is working as a single parent and barely scraping by enough money for food and to keep the roof over their heads! Being lucky has nothing to do with working hard. Besides, if they have SO MUCH money, what's the harm in paying just a LITTLE BIT more?",-1
18,"The theory of the Invisible Hand which states that when individuals try to amass wealth they do so by doing trading, disbursing and employing others which leaves society better off as a whole. While this may be true to some extent, the current stagnation of wealth amongst the very few seems to contradict it. This is where tax brackets come in, an embodiment of the Difference Principle. Imposing higher taxes on the wealthiest and using that money to boost infrastructures that benefit the poorest will help in closing the burgeoning gap between the rich and the poor",-1
18,"The rich are paying a big majority of federal taxes, but their are so many poor that they pay most of taxes, and it may support the government, but all it does is keep the poor, poor; and the rich richer.

18,"Preferably I would have a flat tax, but given the current tax system I believe it makes perfect sense to tax the rich more. In the United States tax system there are several people who don't pay tax because their wages are low. This works out well, however, it needs to be balanced out so the government makes up those revenues elsewhere. Since over taxing what little is left of the middle class would only cause them to fall into the lower group, it make more sense to tax the wealthy who can afford to live without the extra money.",-1
18,"I believe the rich have so much to give but they only use it on them. What I don't understand, is why the government would try and take tax money from those who have nothing, like the lower-classes, when the rich have so much to offer. I don't doubt that the rich work hard to get what they have, but so do the middle-classes; the lower-classes take all the jobs that no one ever wants to do. The rich have way better connections then others do, so why not give back? it's not like they would miss a little money from their massive bank accounts anyways.",-1
18,"A fundamental myth of economics is ""trickle-down"" theory. Supposedly, if you give the rich more money, they will inevitably spend it on products boosting the entire economy. As nice as this is in theory, in actuality, it rarely ever works. Most of the time, the rich actually sit on their wealth, hoarding it. Or, they put it into securities, which have some benefit to the economy as a whole, but little benefit to the lower classes. Yet some negative votes have brought up the theory of the rich fleeing the country and placing money in tax havens. This is true. Thus, the best option is to close significant tax loopholes, such as repatriation (putting money from your company in a foreign branch/department), giving the government the revenue without driving the rich away. A simpler tax code is what the US desperately needs.",-1
18,"The issue is all about increasing the tax of the highest tax bracket, But that is not the approach we need. The upper-middle-class and the lower upper class are not the problems, The real problem is the upper-upper class who have the majority of everyone's money including those who call themselves rich. I propose that there should be a new tax bracket created for those who make over 10 million dollars a year in income personally. That way the only people who lose out are the people who really have so much money they couldn't spend it in one place. In addition, It would truly take away the money from the very wealthy and redistribute it among the less fortunate. This would have the added benefit of making wages more similar throughout the nation thus allowing for more people to live the lives they want to live rather then one constrained by economic hardships.",-1

18,"Before the Tax Reform of 1986, tax rates could be as high as 90% for the wealthy, but the amount they pay also couldn't go over a certain amount. This means everyone is paying as much as they can afford to, but there's also a limit to what can be taken. If we go back the our previous system (or a similar flat tax) which proved to be successful, the poor and middle class will also be paying less taxes, meaning the majority of people will be paying less taxes. Some theorize that this will lead to loss of jobs and lower wages, but this isn't shown in practice. In fact, the economy was quite successful during the time when this system was in place. The top earners and employers of the country aren't going to cut off employees and do anything to make their business less successful, they'll just have less money for themselves personally, in which many of them have more then needed to spend in a lifetime, or even several.",-1

If you were a capitalist, you would say that the rich earned their money so they have a right to it and no one, no government should stand in the way of that. If you were a, maybe not a communist, but a socialist, you would say that they make enough money already and should share it with the rest of us. I lean more towards the socialist side that the rich should share their wealth. This is because, sure, you made all the money yourself and you deserve it. We agree that the rich are (usually) self-made. Now that I think of it, they usually actually are not self made. Usually the money they have was passed down through generations to them and to use the word usually again, they are usually white. But see, either way, it is not about if you made the money all yourself or not. It is about morals and making this country a better place. The rich should definitely share their wealth with the government who will pay back our debts and make this country the strong country it should be.

And to give an example of the contrary, it was reduced to 25% under Hoover, right before the Great Depression. The correlation is clear: when the top bracket is big, America's economy blossoms. And increasing the top rate affects me. I made well over $1,000,000 last year (I don't want to give the exact value)",-1
18,"In reply to one of the negatives (but putting here too) $900,000 can pay for a LOT! If I had that after tax I could pay off my parent's mortgage, pay for at least 2 years off my education degree and still have some left for a holiday. $20,000? That may pay for. Just under a year of my degree (I have 4.5 yr course), with nothing else. Now for that person they have to pay for bills, medicine, education, food, clothes and other living costs. After all that, very little may be able to be taxed. On another note if everyone had to pay the same tax regardless of income then some people in low income situations may be paying more in tax than income. Now they can't afford to eat or live. Many then will either have to rob and commit other crimes, or work on the black market or under the table. Crime increases, drug and sex trafficking increases and none of that money CAN be taxed. Socio Economic problems happen, government spends taxpayer money in police and medical practices to stop it meaning tax increases and the cycle gets out of hand. Also, high socioeconomic problems (and high crime rates) lower foreign interest in a country and thus the investment opportunities drop dramatically, Dollar value decrease but what's the point? No one wants to invest their or buy goods that will have a bigger problem getting out of their and into their own (Customs check goods more if it comes from a higher drug problem country).

That 1% also creates jobs, so less taxes for the rich means more jobs with that extra money. This here is why the job market isn't good: The rich are being taxed to much, and that money filched from them can create jobs. Also, the job market isn't good because nobody is bold enough. Teacher are telling students to work hard to get a job, but with everyone getting jobs, who is creating them? The rich took big risks with their money, failed, and eventually became rich. It wasn't easy. Some may say that the poor deserve more money. However, the welfare program is meant for people who are working hard to make ends meet, not for people who are too lazy to get up. My Grandfather once said, ""People don't just sit and starve to death, they always do something."" The rich earned their money through blood, sweat, and tears, and the government shouldn't begrudgingly penalize them for succeeding in life. Eighty percent of millionaires are self made. Instead of taking money from the rich and give it to the poor, the government should let the rich keep more money, to give the poor jobs.

Tax is A compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers' income and business profits. High-profile rich guys, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg,comment that they want to pay more in taxes. However, raising taxes on the wealthy is the wrong approach that will hurt everyone. Tax hikes on the rich are unjustified from a moral and a pragmatic perspective. All persons are entitled to keep the fruits of their own labour. People should be free to spend or donate their rightfully earned money as they please without government coercion. It is unjust for the government to forcibly take money from one person to give to someone else in the name of “fairness.” well if I talk about fairness, no matter what society, culture, country you go to or come from their will be corrupt people that only seek personal gain. Government and people are judging on to make rich make more tax just because the hard earned money is indirectly going to the corrupt government . As in India, the mind map of the politicians is to make rich pay more taxes on the sympathetic note that all this money will go in development of the nation and in help for the needy , and actually manipulate them and snatch into their own pockets. One simply becomes rich if they get educated, have the willpower for doing something benevolent .It is education that can make the difference between rich and poor. It is the poor who haven't taken education seriously I would like to question my opponents on the note that why should the government help the poor where they don't want to get educated and become affluent. Why should the rich give more taxes to help poor. Why should they let go their hardships? Today's world is a unsympathetic virtue.",1
18,"What a lot of people don't understand about this country, is how it was founded. Colonists came from other countries to America for ""religious freedom."" This is what we're told, when in actuality they came for economic freedom. America at its birth was full of opportunities. The tobacco crop as well as new land brought a lot of hardworking people (who could not move up in their countries) to America where they could be someone if they worked hard enough. The revolutionary war was about taxation without representation. The British government was taking the colonist's money as well as establishing British corporations in the new lands so that the colonies could not compete and therefore not prosper individually. Without incentive, people don't work hard...It is sad but a true fact of the human condition. Therefore we rebelled. This rebellion created a nation where people were not ""equal"" but had ""equality of opportunity."" People in this day and age confuse those two terms greatly. Everyone in this country has the ability to work hard, go to school, and make money. Some people may have a harder path, but the path is still their. That is why people come to this country!!!!!! The capitalist economy creates incentive, competition, and therefore progress. Do you think you would have the iPhone in your hand without private enterprises. And do you think those enterprises would exist if people were taxed higher and given no incentive? As far as inheritance goes, it will always be at play...Because the first and smallest society is that of the family. Should a mother or father who makes something great not be able to pass that down to their offspring? It can be frustrating when people simply inherit money but it is not wrong. The first society is family then comes that of the state. This country wants equality. How is segregating the rich and making them pay more, equal? Please explain that to me.",1

Those programs don't teach people how to be financially stable or be independent, rather it makes them think they can get whatever they need right away. The other thing is that taxing the rich more doesn't show financial equality. I'm in favor of a same tax system where everyone pays the same percentage of taxes, and shows equality.",1

The middle class is people who can't buy businesses, But can live comfortably in their homes. The middle class is a good indicator of a healthy society that isn't oppressed. Just stop.

I think that corporations should be taxed according to a flat tax, And should be regulated so that fixed proportions of profit go to employee bonuses and fixed portions go to owners as dividends. This would allow the owners of companies to ride the same winds as their employees, But still be able to profit greatly depending on their equity in the company. And, Once a corporation occupies a space too big for real competition, It should be dismantled or broken up, And not allowed to use it's size to eliminate competition by selling below cost or other unfair practices. Even Amazon started as a small company, And Jeff Bezos took financial risks to get it going. For every Amazon there are 10 companies no one ever heard of, That failed to make it, And cost the original owners their homes or put them in deep debt. Extreme profitability is the reward for taking risks and should be honored.",1
18,"Think about it. More then not these ""rich"" people became this way through their own brilliance, Own ideas, And own hard work. And many of these people already do donate, Or at least have non-profit or charitable funds for the poor. And while you were working 6 or 7 hours a day, They were losing sleep building their business. it's merely a matter of entitlement. Therefore the rich should not be taxed more. As a matter of fact, A large percentage or the lower income economy don't have working mothers of fathers, And only rely on the money from YOUR wallets to get by. Now, I'm not saying this is true for everyone, But I am pointing out a legitimate point. Plus, A lot of the money from the rich is used to run the company/business they are in.",1
18,"Poor people are also greedy. They want money, wealth, power etc. just as much as anyone else, and while they might not even see it themselves, the only reason they're pushing for ""equality"" with higher tax rates on the rich is to line their own pockets. I guarantee that if the same people demanding this were rich, and were the one's getting taxed more, they would object to it. They support equality so long as it benefits themselves, and if that's the case, their opinions should be held as invalid. If they're so concerned about the poor/those in poverty, why don't they all just live in tents and live off of the bar minimum food scraps so they can support some truly impoverished families in Africa?",1
18,"For the most part, wealthy individuals are hardworking and smart with their money. If i went through 10 years of medical school or built my business from the ground up, i would expect to live a more comfortable life then the person who dropped out of high school. That being said, I wouldn't mind paying more taxes if i saw the money going to the right places. If someone has ptsd from defending our country, a single working mother has to support her kids or a disabled individual needs government help, then by all means give them %75 of my paycheck. But when i see a un-employed healthy work able adult driving around in a 60k escalade talking on their iPhone and counting food stamps, you better believe I'm pissed to see that I'm supporting them to live like they work as hard as i do. If i had it my way, taxes would be placed on what you buy, not on how hard you work.",1
18,Just because they make more money doesn't mean it's the middle and lower classes right to take it. They should pay the same amount normal people do and whatever the law is. They shouldn't have to pay for some lazy person's food stamps that doesn't want to get a job.,1
18,Because i'm sure someone in their family or the rich themselves have worked hard to get the money they have so why would they have to pay more? Punishing someone for the time and effort they put in to their job. I strongly believe in my opinion and think that the rich should not be taxed more,1
18,The rich work their ass off to get money so why should they give it to people that are lazy and don't want a job? They can fundraise if they want but it's their money that was earnt so they shouldn't pay for everyone else! it's your responsibility to work!,1
18,"Rich people and lesser class people should have to pay the same percent in taxes because most people would argue that everyone is equal and that means that everyone should pay an equal percent weather it be 10%, 20% or 30%. If those who do have more money than others pay the same percentage they are still paying more than those with less because 10% of 500,000 is 50,000 and 10% of 60,000 is 6,000 so in the end rich people pay the same ratio but they also pay more just because they're paycheck is bigger.",1

18,"The rich didn't get their money by doing nothing, the majority of the wealthy are good investors and have worked a long time to reach their current balance. If the taxes are, say 10%, a man or woman with a balance of $500,000 would pay $50,000. A man or woman with a balance of $3,000,000 would pay $300,000 which is a great deal larger than the previous. Raising the tax on the wealthy would be unacceptable. Their money is theirs, not the governments.",1
18,"Just because they have more money doesn't mean they need a higher tax rate. They have worked for the position they maintain and don't deserve to be charged for their efforts. Taxing them more would not make the world a better place so why do it? If the poor disagree, the answer is to work harder to get to a higher position of authority without being punished.",1
18,"After all, the rich generally do what we want all Americans to do: work hard, earn money, pay taxes and spend or invest what's left. Today's liberal imperatives violate both practicality and ethics when they make it harder to get rich and easier to stay poor. Most people generally start from the bottom and those who work hard will make it in life and become comfortable and maybe even rich",1
18,"Why in the world would we tax people more just because they make more money? That is like making a guy pay more for gas because he drives a Mercedes instead of a Camry. That is like charging a person more for sunscreen because he is pale. It is segregation. I would sure hate to have mountains of student loan debts, debts I took out for food, gas, and other basic necessities, and have a ridiculously high tax rate. I don't disagree that people can work equally as hard and get different salaries, but life comes down to choices. I didn't have a golden spoon feeding me when I put myself through medical school. I just chose to get debts, bust my but, study, and eat baloney sandwiches for 7 1/2 years to get by. Sorry to the people who chose to work somewhere else. I am not saying your less of a person, my dad was a rancher who worked in a factory when money got tight, so I have respect, but just because I chose a more prosperous path doesn't mean you can rob me, and give my money away. If we all have to pay for a sickening government then we all pay the same.",1
18,"Any more than the rich have a right to the money of the poor. All money that is not inherited is earned, and nobody has a right to that money except the person who earned it. It might be moral for wealthy people to give some help to those who are less fortunate, but taxes are mandatory, not voluntary. The government should not enforce morality in this case any more then it should enforce ""morality"" in marriage.",1
18,"Taxing the rich more nurtures a culture where ambition is suppressed and instead of promoting ""the pursuit of happiness"" Such a country would instead be acting contrary to such a principle. Another factor is that such a principle would be (in fact it is) vague. At what point can one be regarded as rich",1
18,"Raising taxes actually gets the government less money because he rich will move their money to tax havens. That means they will also have less money to spend in their business. This means less economic expansion. If you like at times when taxes has been cut dramatically (Harding-Coolidge, Kennedy, Reagan) then you will see far more rapid economic growth and more revenue. This is because less taxes means more people can move into higher tax brackets and then get taxed at a higher rate assuming we are not under a flat tax. A flat tax however, is also good because it encourages fairness and simplicity with only one rate in everyone. More simplicity means that rich people will take more money out of their tax shelters and use it for economic expansion. Send me a challenge if you want to debate this topic.",1
18,"I believe that the rich should pay more. But at the same proportion as everybody else (EG., 10% of income.)

18,"Just because someone is able to go ahead and be successful in the world, does not mean that they should be taxed because of it. A tax should be applied to all people, not just one class of people. It takes years to make a lot of money in the world. Being successful or knowing the ins and outs of a business, economic, or political world is not something to be punished be a tax.

Either that or their parents have given them everything, to ask the top 1% to pay 50%-60% of their millions they earn in taxes should be allowed and actually required.

Such as incorporating yourself to pay the lower company tax, creating trusts etc etc. The smarter thing to do would be to create a system which maximises the tax receipts to put less burdon the middle class. A flat tax with no tax avoidance would achieve a higher tax receipt across the board. This will never happen because of the vested interest of the political and plutocracy classes, it is better to avoid all tax then to pay any.",1
18,Progressive taxation system is unfair. The only fair tax system is true flat rate tax. Those that earn more will already have to pay a higher amount of taxes (dollar wise). Why should those that apply themselves to make more money be burden with a higher tax bracket? It is absolutely wrong.,1
18,"Listen, I don't support the corporate influence, I don't support tax evasion, and I don't support these special breaks wealthy get. Nor do I support the wealthy being taxed stupidly low, but after seeing countless pseudo-progressives call for a 70% tax on the wealthy I had enough. I am going to put is plain and simple. If I came up to you, threatened to take your entire family hostage if you don't give me your wallet so I can donate it to the red cross. I can BET MY MONEY 90% of you would say no. So what makes taxation any different. Oh that's right! It goes towards funding ""public services"" and ""promoting equality"". Oh and BTW the Laffer curve still applies nowadays. Tax the rich and they just hide in offshore accounts. it's counter-productive. In the era of globalization it's much easier to avoid the tax man or just relocate your business all together. it's what corporations did in the 1980's (well that and they lobbied the government), and it's sure as hell what many wealthy are doing now.

Say Bill Gates taxes went up to an astounding 500 million dollars a year. Some people would say ""He worked hard for all that money!"".

The food wouldn't be distributed evenly and their would be haves and have nots. Just like the Countries financial structure. So when things start getting tight who are the people of the town going to turn to. Probably the people who have the most food. Why take food from those who barely have any when their are people with plenty to spare. The same goes for money. When you have it, people are going to put their hands out more then when you don't. Of course in this situation the problem isn't the population running out of food, it's our Nation's mounting debt.",-1

If you want a raise, do it from the bottom up. This would go for any purchases from outside also. So if corporations want to purchase clothes from taiwan, their salary would have to be in pace with the rule also. If found in contempt, the lowest penalty would be let's say 15% the salary of the CEO per attempt. If they want to do business elsewhere then they have to follow this rule. Without these rules, it is too easy to allow for companies to become corrupt. All money received should be percentage based. Also includes inheritance which should have a maximum percentage also to prevent super rich syndrome.",-1

At that point they can spend as they like, who are we to tell them what they would spend their money on. Here's a question, since most middle class or working class Americans make far more than laborer in 3rd world countries, why don't they give to charity? Could it be because of stuff like food, rent, or fuel? Or maybe they want to take their significant others on a date or boy presents. At the end of the day we all need enough to pay our bills and also get the things we want with our hard earned money. I think most people just have a misunderstanding of rich people in general. Now to the main point, our country is capitalistic and run by the free market. In this system a consistent problem is income inequality.

Does their money really fund the enhancement of public education, expand grants, or improve infrastructure? Not in drastic ways, especially when education budgets are continually cut or when projects still exist despite numerous reforms. Case in point, raising taxes on the wealthy isn't going to solve our problems with income inequality. it's a constant, some people will always have more then others.",1
18,I don't think they should because those people worked hard to become wealthy and they worked harder than the rest of those people that's not wealthy but at the same time i would be glad at the same time because it's getting the others better opportunist for the poor people - Rondale,1
18,"No they should not for many reasons. So many wealthy people will just move to other parts of the world where there is no income tax. This happened in 1972, many people moved overseas and as a result the american government lost millions in tax dollars. The rich are the ones who went through (usually) years of education to get to where they are. I agree they should contribute to society, but 50% of their annual income is contributing how much more of a percentage are you planning on taking away? 60%, 70%? Half of their money is already too much even more then half will just cause too many problems and will just produce an upset and unequal society.",1
18,"Most of the big corporations that will be hit by this tax increase will only increase their prices on the goods they're selling..Leaving consumers to pay more so the wealthy can keep earning at a successful rate. So in the end the middle class consumers will still have to pay. Plus why are we trying to split the American people into who has to pay more? We are all citizens, all here for limited time- just trying to make a decent living. Why can't we just cut everyone's tax rate by a certain percent? We would certainly see American people thrive more economically if people used the money to proper use. History proves what's more effective. Cutting taxes-yes. Dividing tax rates and putting the American people against each other-no.",1
18,"Where has it gotten us? Raise taxes on all income over 1 million dollars, in increments of 5 million dollars. Ex) 40% for income over 1 million; 42.5% for income over 5 million; 45% for income over 10 million, and so on. Actors/actresses, professional athletes, entertainers, reality TV mutants, Bank CEOS, Wall Street (of which I am a part--commodities trader) and the list goes on, will not be hurt in the least. We need to invest in the United States again. We need to rebuild our infrastructure, an infrastructure that has gone from a top 5 international ranking to 17th in a decade. We need to invest in science and medicine. The trickle-down theory does not work. it was only stimulus--that was why HW Bush had to raise taxes. With the top 2% seeing their incomes grow by 300+% over the past 3 decades, and with the same top 2% receiving 93% of all post recession income gains, the system needs to be reformed. If we can send soldiers--avg. salary of $42,000-- to the Middle East to die, we can ask millionaires to pay more.",-1
18,"For rich investors to get a break on income that happens to come from their investments, rather than as a paycheck, is unfair. We are committed to progressive taxation in the USA, following a system in which the more you make, the more you pay.

18,"We keep hearing about small businesses creating jobs. I don't think that millionaires and billionaires are people with small businesses. Also after the tax rate was lowered by GWB for the wealthy the number of jobs being created plummeted.

Maybe then we will be able to do something about our crumbling infrastructure.",-1

18,"Equality in taxing is the only thing that can make capitalism fair to everyone in all economic and social classes. What I mean by equality isn't a flat tax rate across the board.

This is the only way to correct the ongoing growing gap between social and economic classes.",-1

This income should be taxed according to the normal tax rate, which is 35%.",-1

This means that businesses will be less likely to expand, (and have less money to do so) meaning less job creation and economic growth.

Based on past history, can the government even be trusted with the money they are making in tax revenues, let alone more of it? Additionally, relying primarily on rich people as a source of tax revenue can backfire. When the economy falters, they, too, suffer. If anything, the capital gains tax should be lowered.",1

Yet, if someone thinks through the issue without emotion, it is only logical to let wealthy people keep more of their wealth.

(In real day to day life, This is what we all do, Weather it be a burger for lunch, Or, Gas for the care, We pay EXACTLY our fair share. ) Then, After you pay the $5k you owe for that year, All will be free and motivated to push to earn more, Innovate, Create, Etc.

Once on the corporation's net revenue and again when I get paid? Or do I invest it elsewhere? Corporate income is diminished, therefore stockholder interest is diminished. It really creates an underperforming market. This first example mostly hurts retirees who invest a large portion of their money into corporations. They would make far more money if their investments paid out properly. 2. Competition. If the government wants more money and a much better economy and less welfare, they need a 0% corporate tax. Not only does it encourage new businesses, but it also encourages foreign and offshore businesses to come to the US. They will bring back loads of capital, taxes (in the from of shareholder income which is taxable), and of course jobs. As it is I would never start a corporation.

As a result, executives are doing fine, companies are doing fine, Wall Street is doing fine, but the workers on the line are hurting, bad. This situation is a rubber band stretched to its limits, and it will eventually snap.

This kind of all-work atmosphere might work for some, but it allows employers to set higher standards then are healthy on the amount of work they expect. This argument is even more pertinent when talking about women in the workplace and maternity leave. Maternity leave is undeniably important for a mother as it allows her to take care of a child sufficiently while the child is still very young. If a mother would who's to work rather than care for such a young child without the threat of losing credibility in the workplace then I struggle to see why she would choose to be a mother in the first place. However, as long as the option is their, the few who choose to work will set a standard that other women will be expected to meet. An argument that follows from that is that men should take time off when their child is young too, both because the child is equally their responsibility and because women can be seen as less desirable employees because of the threat of maternity leave.

19,"Although this is an interesting and important question, I think it needs to be parsed and clarified. The first question is, for whom should be mandatory? Are you proposing that it be mandatory for people to take vacation or maternity leave even when they don't wish to. Or are you, as I am supposing, making it mandatory for employers to pay employees for vacation time and family/maternity leave. Solely based on the way the question is phrased, I am going to vote no. Let's take these issues separately. Obviously family and maternity leave are currently protected by federal law but on an unpaid basis. For those who are unaware of FMLA, it provides you the ability to take a family or maternity leave without having lost your job upon return, however there is not a provision that you must be paid during said leave. I think the unpaid leave is actually the ideal circumstance as it protects a person's job but provides a strong incentive to make the leave as short as necessary. As much as I hate to say it, there are many people who would take unfair advantage of a family leave it there were continuing to pay them regularly. As far as maternity leave is concerned, employers should offer paid maternity leave but should not be legally required to. Those who are smart enough to do so gain access to a valuable part of the employment market: smart, hard-working, highly-educated women who wish to have children. However, legally requiring employers across the board to pay maternity leave (particularly small employers who would have a difficult time affording this) would likely have the unintended consequence of increased discrimination of women of childbearing age when applying for certain jobs. Paid vacation time is an easier issue for me, I feel comfortable saying no it should not be mandatory. I think it's reasonable to say that the vast majority of jobs available allow for some amount of paid vacation, however paltry; it would be very difficult to attract employees otherwise. It is also in the employer's best interest for his or her employees to be in the best mental framework possible. However from an economic standpoint vacation time and paid salary are fungible assets. If I need to make $80,000 to meet my financial obligations but an employer says he can only offer me $78,000 with four weeks of paid vacation, I would very much like to have the opportunity to negotiate for a job that would pay $82,000 with three weeks vacation. If paid vacation were mandatory and the amount of vacation were set in stone, I would not have that flexibility. In summary, family leave should remain protected but unpaid, their would likely be unintended consequences of legally requiring maternity leave in the from of increased discrimination against young women in the job market and paid vacation time should be encouraged but not made legally necessary",1

While this obsession with money has clouded the healthcare field I think it is important for society to remember that we were all created equally.",-1
19,"I believe that many advanced countries have a national health service for providing free medical care to their citizens. Although it is true that it could be very expensive to maintain, they can find the way through taxes to keep the system. You can't neglect your citizens when they are ill and they can't afford to pay health care.",-1
19,"And health care can be a necessity for survival, where everyone who needs it should be able to get it. It would be nice for all people to be able to get health care services without worrying about the cost of anything. The problem, though, with a single-payer health care system here would be the extremely high cost to the government, considering the existing government debt and the expensiveness of health care. Somehow bring prices down to help whoever pays for health care. I would recommend at least partially subsidizing everyone who needs assistance, through Medicaid. Some people would afford to pay part of their health care costs.",-1
19,"Yes, I believe that basic medical health care, at the minimum, should be given to citizens for free. It has been practice in other countries such as Canada for a long period of time. Health care should not be limited to those that can afford it. Free basic health care will, in the long run, a better option for the government because money is saved when health issues are caught before they become an issue.",-1
19,Basic medical health care should be given to all citizens for free. The more that we can do for our citizens to remain healthy then we have an obligation to make sure that happens. I think that medical care was getting way too expensive for anybody to be able to afford.,-1
19,"I would have preferred the government make a universal health care act more like this, then the one that they did. This would have allowed the government to price control a large chunk of medical services in the United States, especially those services most needed by the poorer populations. Then insurance companions could have still sold extension packages and add ons, more than likely at lower prices, which would implement a private sector price control at the same time. It would have helped bring down cost, while at the same time giving everyone a bare minimum, because in the end medical care is, since its inception, has been a basic freedom.",-1
19,Yes basic medical health care should be given to all citizens for free as they are the ones working and taking care of the smaller stuff in the country that most people would not do. By giving them free health care you can insure that all your citizens are healthy and happy workers that can keep the country progressing in the right direction.,-1
19,"Other advanced countries such as Canada and France have great free healthcare. I don't care how high the tax is, it is very much needed. The medical industry is a huge money making machine and their prices are too high. The insurance companies are in on it to. It is only human to let people get access to the medicines and treatment they need.",-1
19,I think this because people could overuse drugs and maybe get addicted.Also if you overuse drugs germs will adapt and get stronger.The state will have to pay a lot of money to buy medicine and put us at a economic disadvantage.it's more important to have money to buy medicine then have no money at all.,1
19,"It is not realistic for the government to provide free healthcare to all its citizens. Even countries that have universal health care cannot grant it for free, because they heavily tax their citizens to pay for it. It is better for people to pay for their own health care.",1
19,"No. I don't believe basic medical health care should be given to all citizens for free, because of the economical effects it would have on the country. America already has so much debt, and a limitless number of welfare program. This policy would only serve to compound that problem.",1
19,"The wealthy can afford to pay for their own health care so they should have to. And criminals don't deserve to be taken care of. They should be on their own. But otherwise, I say medical care should be a right rather than a commodity. Average shmos should only have to pay for luxury items.",-1

In truth, Red Bull does little more than coffee, and to imply otherwise simply to increase sales for the overpriced drink is extremely deceptive.",-1

Over the counter medications must already post on their label or reading material supplied of any known side effects. If you don't read the material, that is not their fault. With prescribed medications, your doctor is suppose to either tell about or provide literature for hazards associated with the medication. If the product is prepackaged, it too would have this information either on the label or in the box. In the case of filled or refilled medications, your doctor and/or pharmacist can/does provide this information.

21,If a company has risen to a monopoly level their must be a reason for such a thing. Even without considering such a thing competitors could still open up shop and compete with low prices meaning everything would balance out eventually. their is simply no reason for it to be illegal in the first place,1

21,No one has the right to tell a business that they can't provide a service or product because they don't have competition. No one is entitled to products and services. A company must be able set prices even if there is no competition. A government that would impose price regulations and any other regulations on a company for being a monopoly is a immoral government. Hindering profits is theft. Freedom is the supreme choice.,1
21,Yes monopolies should be illegal. Monopolies go against the idea of capitalism. They weed out all competition. The company that owns the monopoly is then free from any rules and regulations because no one would survive without them. We would be paying thousands of dollars and certain companies would rule the world.,-1
21,"If a corporation can have monopoly on a medicine it can just shock raise the cost on that medicine as it wishes. Monopolies on a specific care can be legal, But not monopoly on all cars.

This price is set regardless of the demand for the product due to the consumer has no one else to go to. Monopolies should not be legal, due to the price that they can set, for in the example of the utility Electric Company. We don't have another company to go to for electricity, therefore we must pay the price that the company dictates to us. If we had another electric company, then there would not be any rising of prices, the competition would drive the price down. That is where Technology should come in.",-1
21,"No they should be illegal because I believe that it is good for the owner such as Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and John D Rockefeller. For example, It raises the prices which makes the profit better to be sold for the so-called owners and it's bad because it makes the price is so high the citizens of the US cannot pay and or live without the rules and regulations which would lead into the owners taking over all the profits ever made",-1

For example if monologue should be band how are you expecting or poor people to survive even rich people. In regard you you agree with me that monopoly should not be band.",-1
21,Monopolies should not be legal as this is not encouraging improvement in products instead making companies more money. If monopolies are legal it means that they can raise price but also lower the quality this making them more money. This meaning that consumers will need to buy this product a lot more.,-1
21,"This should NEVER be legal. It leads to pay cuts, costs hikes and a lack of choice. Monopolies are, in reality, entirely criminal. Free enterprise and the ability to have variety and make a personal selection (or to simply have other options in the event of unexpected change or complications) is a basic freedom that everyone should possess.",-1
21,"No, I don't think that monopolies should be legal and that monopolies create an atmosphere of unfair competition between businesses. When their are monopolies, they can set the prices at any level that they want and make consumers pay those prices, as well as treat customers poorly which is why they should never be legalized.",-1
21,"We need to have a little competition. For example, we have a monopoly on our electric company. We have no choice but to pay their increasing prices because they know we have to. It is either that, or switch to a generator. That is not a very good option. If we had another electric company, Gulf Power might think twice about raising the prices.",-1
21,Monopolies should not be legal. Giving one company the power to have a monopoly would be a very dangerous thing. People can do all kinds of things with that much power and even in a sense be more powerful and have more say then the President. In my opinion a monopoly would be dangerous.,-1
21,"If I am holding a basketball tournament to find the best basketball team (a consumer finding the lowest price), I would like as many teams to join into the tournament as possible (more competition is good). Preventing teams from joining would be bad (barriers to entry). However, as the tournament progresses, teams will be eliminated (consumers choosing not to shop at expensive businesses). Eventually, their may be a winner (EG. Walmart). In most industries, the tournament never ends and their is not a winner because many teams are often equally matched and/or new teams continually enter the tournament.",1

It should sell some of its shares, but not enough to lose control. It has the right to remain private. Although the government has the usual ability to seize items for fair compensation, so that can be employed in extreme measures.",1
21,"Some people may argue that monopoly has a detrimental effect on the society, but is not necessarily the case. When the monopoly exists (such as standard oil), citizens' choices are limited, therefore coerced to accept some choices that they may not desire. However, it is a well-known fact that the goal of any corporation is to maximize their profits by offering a world-class customer service. Therefore, the United States Should allow monopoly to exist for the better service of her people.",-1
21,"To begin with, I do understand that the United States Government must sometimes offer aid and or council to certain businesses to stimulate our economy. However, in contrast, the United States Government's largest responsibility is to citizens of the United States of America, therefore while I support the argument that our government faces situations in which it ""should"" aid and or offer council to large corporations, the best interest of the citizens of the United States of America cannot, under any circumstances, be compromised. (What exactly is in the best interest of United States Citizens is a debate in itself though).",-1
21,"Although monopolies can have a few (rare) good effects, we have seen firsthand what corporate greed and lack of competition can lead to. We must regulate and break up monopolies like Teddy Roosevelt did to the trusts. Their is little to prevent price gouging when their is a lack of competition or control. What you argue for would make it all to easy for corporation to become more powerful than they already are. Monopoly by definition means no competition. So, unsatisfied customers have nowhere else to take their business. Monopolies can treat their customers like scum and not lose any business. This is bad for everyone involved. We can see where lack of control leads to in countries like China. Corporations already have far to much power with Lobbyist's and many politicians in their back pocket. What you are arguing for is to give them even more control this cannot be tolerated.",-1

21,"Any monopoly will cause trouble for consumers who are trying to survive in a vicious economy. Standard Oil should be broken up, but I fear that the government may try to take control of the oil industry which would also hurt consumers. If the government encourages small oil companies to compete and supports them, it would take away the monopoly without threatening the people.",-1
21,"Yes, the monopoly of Standard Oil should be broken up. Although our Federal government has become much too large and powerful, still it's main mission needs to be the care and protection of its citizens. This includes seeing to it that citizens aren't held hostage by something over which they have no control. Most of us can't go out into our backyard and drill an oil well, build a refinery in the garage and process our own gasoline. Therefore, it is up to our government to care for and protect us by breaking up monopolies that allow a very few to reap huge profits while the rest suffer.",-1
21,"I think more competition would be good for vehicles, the Earth, fuel sources and mass transportation in general. When you only have a few hands holding all the oil it's not good. Alternate fuel sources would definitely go a long way in making this a reality. Not to mention that eventually our main sources of fuel are going to expire, which in turns makes it harder on everyone.",-1

21,"Standard Oil did in fact have a monopoly in the 1880s, But by 1911 they held only 60 percent of the market and their grip on the US oil market was no stranglehold. The government should have let the free market run its course on Standard Oil instead of breaking it up.",1
21,"Think about it, if you piss them off they would raise the prices, but as long as they are happy, and not greedy they will keep the prices down. It is the same as the middle east with our oil. We wouldn't have to buy oil from them, but our government is selfish and sells our oil to other countries, for a major profit, and then uses that money to buy from the middle east. And what happens when they are mad? Our gas prices sky rocket. Why is it ok for them to be a monopoly, but we cant have them in side our country???",1
21,"No because this already happened in 1911. Standard Oil Co. Inc. Was an American oil producing, transporting, refining, and marketing company.

Standard Oil dominated the oil products market initially through horizontal integration in the refining sector, then, in later years vertical integration; the company was an innovator in the development of the business trust. The Standard Oil trust streamlined production and logistics, lowered costs, and undercut competitors. ""Trust-busting"" critics accused Standard Oil of using aggressive pricing to destroy competitors and from a monopoly that threatened consumers. John D. Rockefeller was a founder, chairman and major shareholder. With the dissolution of the Standard Oil trust into 33 smaller companies, Rockefeller became the richest man in the world.",1

Rockefeller, the greatest businessman that ever lived, who lit the homes of every household in America, who provided millions from exports, who gave the world cheap kerosene and vaseline and hundreds of other useful products, got sued for screwing people?

But if I don't ever go to the zoo, why should I have to pay for the zoo? I shouldn't have to pay for recreational facilities unless I choose to go their and then I can pay admission to get in.",1
25,"These venerable and good institutions need funding, but they should not get it from the taxpayers. Taking money from someone and saying that they now must fund a museum that they don't like, or a zoo that they don't agree with, or so on, is wrong. Thomas Jefferson once said something to the effect that it is 'sinful' to take money from someone to force them to fund something they don't believe in. These institutions should be funded solely by people who believe in them.",1
25,"So many debates over this which is pointless. We need to educate the young and in doing so those artifacts have to be stored somewhere. Wherever that ""somewhere"" is, it is going to cost money. This is just something we have to deal with. I am fine with paying for these sites.",-1
25,"Museums, zoos, and science centers are important to a broad range of learners in society. These places are accessible to those who can't or don't or won't make connections in a traditional classroom. They also serve as a supplement to classroom and lifelong learning.

They are great resources for students who don't know about the possibilities that are available in the world. These institutions are not solely relying on government assistance, and in most cases match or surpass government aid through business grants, donations, and sales.

25,The work these institutions do is not don't by other educational institutions. Usually each has a specific focus so that visitors know how to locate an appropriate place for learning about their choice of topic. Such operations tend to draw more people from beyond their immediate area as well as providing a service to their local community.,-1
25,"All these things are a part of education, and education should be available for everyone who wants it. Anyone who wants to use them can use them. Most people benefit from them. In the interest of not letting a minority control the majority, I would say that most people are ok with having publicly funded, educational things like this. I also don't think that they cause individual taxpayers that much (a few bucks per person per year?)",-1

These institutions are created for the good of the public, so the public can come and learn about science, art, animals, etc. They also serve as research and conservation centers for the community.

25,"I can actively remember attending museums and zoos as a form of learning. If we fund schools, why should we not fund museums? their are displays and exhibits that schools cannot duplicate, like dinosaur bones, art pieces and live animals in simulated habitats. Without them, our students only suffer in areas, like art, which have been severely underfunded already.",-1
25,"Tax dollars go to fund schools, colleges and universities, and they should also be used to support museums, zoos and science centers.

25,"Zoos, museums, and science centers should be funded by taxpayers' money, because they are incredible learning experiences, and the public should have free access to such valuable learning tools. When I was a teenager, my favorite places were the Detroit Zoo, the Detroit Institute of the Arts, and the U of M Exhibit Museum of Natural History. All were free, so, I could go as often as I wanted. Going to the zoo improved my geography, the art museum improved my photography, and the museum of natural history was fun.",-1
25,"The goal of a museum, zoo or science center is to accumulate and display scientific and natural resources. Privatizing them would damage the scientific value of the collections because they would have to remain profitable and would be heavily influenced by the corporation that operates the display. This could potentially lead to censorship or bias. By having the museums operated by publicly funded non-profit groups, censorship and bias by corporations can be more easily avoided, and the scientific value of the displays becomes greater.",-1
25,The only way to write history is to fund it. I personally would not mind if part of my tax money was used to fund the very institutions that would be used to secure a part of history.

25,Recreational facilities are given to citizens by the government free of cost but the government bears some cost for it and it should be funded by the taxpayers' money because they are the ultimate beneficiaries of such facilities. Same is true for the science centers as advancement in technology will ultimately benefit the taxpayer. So I would say that both of them should be funded through taxpayers' money.,-1
25,"I believe that zoos, museums, and science centers are vital assets to the growth of children. Children greatly benefit from trips to these public centers, and I do think that designating tax money towards places like these is absolutely necessary.

25,"In the same way that public schools are funded with taxpayer money, so should museums, science centers and zoos, as long as they comply with the separation of church and state (ie. not a Creationist museum). These centers exist to educate the general public, including children, and this is already happening overseas - the Natural History Museum is free of charge in London, England. Keeping these centers funded with public money is also a way to foster a community-wide education so that residents can voice their opinions and concerns on the content of these centers, thus improving the experience for everyone.",-1

25,"Yes, American tax dollars should go towards the funding of national art museums. The arts in general, and specifically national art museums, are integral parts of our national pride and linked very closely to a well-rounded education for our nation's young people. In addition, national art museums can provide some historical context with regard to art today. Without tax dollars helping fund museums there would be no way that they could remain open and continue to flourish.",-1
25,"Tax dollars from American Citizens essentially go towards those items mentioned in the Preamble of the United States Constitution which include establishing justice, ensuring 'domestic tranquility' (which also means certain foreign affairs to ensure it), providing for the common defense (police forces and National Guard), promoting general welfare (government aid programs, financial aid, and fixing issues with roads or public institutions such as parks, buildings, or monuments), and securing the 'blessings of liberty' (which entails legislation and enforcement of it). Part of the 'general welfare' and 'blessings of liberty' arguably include the expressions of great masters of art throughout the ages be they fine arts or performing arts. These works of art, like monuments to events and sacrifices, detail periods of our history in a most beautiful way in the perception of people who helped shape the world even during their own time (not to mention continue to do so now). Art Museums are one of the few places where these timeless works (save for film and literature which have other havens) are kept, preserved by professionals, and even given meaning to the listening visitors on tour. Since such a thing would indeed help 'promote the general welfare', then it is only right that Americans who uphold and love their country allow tax dollars to protect those works that helped shape the country they love and continue to exhibit one of it's most precious rights: freedom of expression.",-1

25,"I simply refuse to pay more taxes to support independently owned art museums, it would be as if Americans were paying for theme parks. We shouldn't because already our taxes are to high and are gonna be even higher paying for basically entertainment. Not all museums will be paid for through taxes so other untaxed art facilities will be enraged. Paying taxes for museums is paying taxes for businesses and we don't spend any tax dollars on a non governmental business. Last of all the argument that art is used for relief for depressed individuals is unnecessary because we already pay taxes for medical purposes which also includes anti depressant medications for depressed people. In conclusion Americans should not be required to pay taxes for art museums because taxes are already to high, untaxed facilities will create a bias, paying for independent businesses is absurd, and we pay taxes for depressed individuals already through medicare.",1

25,"No, I don't think American tax dollars should go towards the funding of national art museums, because it is not the appropriate function of the government to spend on art. People can spend their own money to support the arts. Supporting art museums is not in the constitution and not a function of government.",1
25,"Art, in all its forms, can be subjective. Certain people enjoy specific types of art and not others. Not everyone will agree. The government should not be in the business of doling out money to support one organization and not another, thusly determining what is art and using our money to support their opinion. If art organizations require money to remain in operation, then those organizations should fund their own causes, not force Americans to pay for things that they may not want to support.

But can you imagine the world without art? I imagine the world as a dry and boring desert field. In my opinion, Governments should support the arts through funding. Here are some reasons why. First of all, It can build the country brand and promote tourism. To further explain, With government support, We can make good art, And it can even promote our country's art, And this can attract tourists, And our country can be famous for the arts. For example, Mount Rushmore represents one of the world's largest pieces of sculpture, As well as one of America's most popular tourist attractions. But did you know that Mount Rushmore is one of the most famous government-funded art? Now, Mount Rushmore is so famous that an average of 2, 311, 273 people visits Mount Rushmore every year. With government funding, Our country can improve with the arts.",-1

The clothes and shoes you wear, the TV and movies you watch, the beautiful interface on the phone in your pocket and on your laptop, the jewelry around your neck and on your hands, and so much more were all created by a person with an education in the arts. As a BFA University student, I know how important it is for these amazing minds to get help funding their projects after they leave school. Many projects being undertaken are beneficial to large groups of people and it is ignorant to think that the government funding the arts = the government funding someone painting as a hobby in their basement.",-1
25,"Our entire lifestyle depends on technological ideas that were completely intangible during the vast majority of human existence. That is far more exciting to me then keeping a few tax dollars. I don't know what the next great ideas will be, I just know they don't fit on paper, can't be summarized with a dollar sign, and that the future is full of surprises. Then again, I want us to invest in art for social and natural scientists, engineers and mathematicians. The nine-to-five workday trains technical experts to become robotic, but we have much to gain from empowering their creative sides. We face bizarre problems to solve - HIV, for example, is an innovative and creative virus, and making progress against it will require a strong blend technical precision and artistic creativity. Our investments in creativity should not be reserved for actors, painters, and the rest of the classic artists. If anything, our individual brains and collective economy have far more to gain from affording technical people more time to be artistic, and empowering artsy people to be more technical.",-1

25,"Yes, but a qualified 'yes'. The question should be clarified. Art is about creativity and expression. Now, if one particular expression is favored, then I say 'no'. But, of course, this doesn't necessarily have to be the case. Giving tax dollars to open a new museum or foster revitalization of dilapidated downtowns could provide great benefit. We already fund schools that teach art.",-1

This vouchers would adjust spending of the people in a direction which helps other sectors, their is also this need art sector can provide show and events specially for the NHS, Police and council and paid through their budget, It will help their budget to be used in right and balanced way, Those groups receive huge findings and that could be partially help their local art and events venues, The venues need to be supported for corporation sponsorship in wider range, there are more companies may be able to help but they had not been identified or contacted, So the answer is yes we better support art through right ways,",-1

If we starve the artists, We are destroying our future. their are so many starving artists that barely get by because of friends and family. It is unfair because artists are by far one of the hardest working people, Who usually don't get pay or credit until they ""make it"". And sometimes it happens after their death. We need to support the artist.",-1

They thought some mechanic just make their cars but they don't know that designer are the one who design their cars. If all cars are made just for its purpose, then what is the difference between all those cars. That' s to show the importance of arts in our daily life. To government, I think most people know that art museums are tourist attractions and they are plenty of famous sculpture/monuments In the world that is a symbol to the country. And tourist means money so why would u think government don't want money? Plus, art is also culture and culture is the easiest way for government to convey their message or agenda to the civilian people. Art is culture and culture is the pride and the identity of a country so why would the government want to let arts get vanish? But I do agree that their are some artists who pretends to be an artist and create trash but call it artworks. So government should make a way to filter between true artist and the fake one. Because true artist will be a benefit to the country while fake artist will only bring the country to humiliation.",-1

Considering the economy, we should abandon the arts and concentrate on improving the sciences which have led to the present developed society.

If college was free a higher standard of living would be possible and a bigger boom in economy; an example is the 1950s the standard of living was increased and we saw a thriving economy. Attendance in high school was an outcome of the standard of living increase and once again it would be if higher education was free.,-1
25,"Yes, college education should be free. A college education should be provided for every child who wants it. And this should be provided free of charge. It is morally wrong for a teenager and their family to be forced to incur thousands and thousands of dollars in debt for an education. Learning should not be out of anyone’s reach. Learning and education should not be privileges enjoyed only by the wealthy. Right now college loan defaults are at the highest levels ever seen. We have an entire generation that is starting out in life burdened with a very large amount of debt and a very small job market. Our society has set these young adults up for possible failure by making them start out at a disadvantage.",-1

It should be pay as you go and pay only for the classes you need, none of this pay for art when your going to learn something that has nothing to do with art. College is run too much like high school, with clubs, immature kids partying. Drinking drugs, it's pathetic grow up already. However, if it were free, everyone would have the opportunity to learn skills to contribute to society, feel needed valued and part of a community, no one would need to feel inferior, or superior, bringing the playing field level. No one would feel the need to compete. But it will not happen, because the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class supports them all, many intelligent people are denied the chance to help humanity for the good due to this greed.

I would love to go to a university or even stay at school as long as I please to get multiple degrees. The cost of college courses are too expensive. Money and the fear of debt from student loans hold people back from pursuing their dreams or making the most out of themselves. I agree yes it can be taken advantage of, but not if you set up certain GPA requirements. People say ""High school part 2"" but that is not the case. High school is a mandatory by law. Children, without consent, are required to go to high school. Children who did not want to attend high school more than likely won't want to attend college. I believe the opportunity to further your education should be given to all.",-1
25,"It makes me angry seeing those snarky remarks by people who think certain people shouldn't enroll at their college or be in their classes, simply because they slacked off or failed math three times in high school, which means they won't take education seriously and it shouldn't be free because of that reason. Most kids find the structure of high school stifling and not every system is going to be helpful or easy for every student. And, not every kid is going to be fantastic at every subject. When you start saying that you deserve a college education because you worked harder than anyone else is when you start sounding entitled and you don't realize how privileged you are. Maybe, those kids who got all D's never had someone to encourage them to be better and do better. Maybe, no one told them that grades and GPAs don't predict your future success and only loosely correlate with intelligence. College is not mandatory, it's an option, but it shouldn't be an option that's out of reach for so many. These rich people who run the country will never give us free college (maybe not at this moment in time but hopefully 60 years from now haha), but nevertheless we should definitely fight for significantly less tuition costs and put a cap on it, because education should be a right for everyone. Entitlement is NOT wanting equal footing for all and NOT wanting to acknowledge an unjust system that so blatantly ignores the disadvantaged circumstances between race, class, gender and sexuality. Some kids weren't given the same opportunities as some, such as test prep classes, career counseling, college counseling, extracurricular activities, etc. So, they're told every day that they didn't work hard enough, they're not good enough and that they won't look as good as most other applicants on a scholarship or college application. And, why can't free college be a hope for these kids to make something of themselves and to get to experience opportunities they weren't given in high school??? I think college should be free. If you don't, then obviously you're the entitled one.",-1

People may argue that somebody has to pay for it, but let's think about it for a minute. On a national scale, we already pay for services that we may not use. Example? High School. What if your kid goes to a private school, is home schooled, or is a school drop out? What if they graduated? What if we don't have kids at all? We still have to pay for public schools. If we had free college education, then more people could pursue the education they desperately deserve, which increases the amount of people to be able to find jobs that are capable of doing so.",-1
25,"Education should not be paid for. Knowledge is power and why must power be paid for? We'll continue a cycle of reaching for power, even though, it should be equal. Why must those born into a high class have greater chances of success compared to those born into a lower class setting? Yes, most are afraid college will be treated as ""high school part 2,"" but that doesn't mean the rules of a college have to be the same. For example, for those in community colleges cannot be in their more then 6 or 7 or 8 years or else they're kicked out FOREVER in that college. That'll sure push them to take it seriously. Hmm, perhaps 4 dropouts from a class should lead to a kick as well. By the way, high school and college follow a completely different system and shouldn't be compared. I'm positive the more serious students in a college will out-way the goofballs, making the goofballs a step closer to becoming serious students.",-1
25,"If college was free, it would literally mean High school all over again. Do you any idea on how many people would take college for granted if it was free. College being free would literally mean high school all over again. I am currently a high school senior who is heading off to college this year and I can say that most of the kids in my school don't care one bit. They are out in the hallways hanging out with their friends, smoking, drinking and causing fights with others and you can just imagine what it would be like if kids like those went off to attend college with very little effort put into their school work. You have to remember that college is for those people that truly care for their education and unlike college, high school is meant to give a very basic education to people. Unlike High school, college is an option that one can decide to take or leave behind and for those who really want to educate themselves further, they go into it and it's worth every penny for them. I have to admit that although college is quite expensive and that I might have a hard time affording it, it would be worth much more knowing that the majority of students around me care for their education unlike in high school. What really bothers me is that more than 3 fourths of the people that took this survey ignorantly said the wrong answer.",1
25,"Number one: the government needs the colleges to pay them so the government can pay them back (for things like staff and other things). If they don't get this money then the government won't get this flow of money and we will be stuck in a deficit for the rest of our lives. This may also lead to higher taxes and that means, of course, you have to pay way more money. If you get a scholarship then you are set for a college. And if you don't then maybe you might not be the best in it.",1
25,"For the people who keeping arguing that college education is the key to success, of course it is nowadays! That doesn't mean it should be free. As the top argument for ""No"" states, free college would definitely not be appreciated. Unfortunately, I've had the displeasure of hearing people in my English class say they just go to college because their financial aid pays for it. A lot of them take the course, don't take it seriously enough and slack off, then just take the ""W"" on their transcript. I'm not saying that everybody who uses financial aid abuses it, but a lot of students already take college for granted. Many of the fields in college would also become oversaturated more than they are today. Not everybody can go to college, that is how scarcity works in the real world. It is nice and pleasing to hear all these nice thoughts that free college education is the key to a higher societal values and culture, but it's just not for everybody. Also, we can't just add this boatload of debt onto taxes where further debt will be accumulated. it's not impossible to find an affordable route through college. One could always go to a community college for two-three years and then transfer to the university of choice, often with better chances of admission. their are also a lot of scholarships out their that people say they try and try again to get, but never really do it. A job throughout college is also easily achievable to maintain if you manage your time wisely. People more often than not love to make excuses for themselves and opt for the aesthetically pleasing choice then the responsible one. This is college and it's time to be an adult. The age of entitlement is over; we need to account for ourselves now. College is not a right, it is a privilege.",1
25,"their is no denying that the cost of college is out of control and it does need to be fixed. Going all the way to the other extreme is not the answer though. If it becomes free for the student then everyone else will pick up the tab for them. We do, however, need to tweak our system and bring the cost down and cap it. Not to mention the cost of books for school. That is another cost of school that has exploded that we need to bring down. Free school is not the answer for this country. We have a struggling economy, paired with poor spending. Adding school to an unbalanced budget would not save this country, especially at this time. Even if those who received a degree earned more, and in doing so paid more in taxes, that will still cost us now while we cannot afford it to get paid back after the damage is don't. If we limit the cost of public universities and put community colleges on a sliding scale, that would be a better fix. Anyway you look at this, there is no simple answer. We need a more educated America, but we cannot afford to foot the bill at this moment.",1
25,"No, I don't think college should be completely free. it should be on a cheaper sliding scale then it is now, with more availability for poor students to get better loans. It can be made effectively free, but to make it $100 completely free for everyone would mean that the government would be paying for it, and everyone's taxes would go up. And what if young people get this free education and do nothing with it? They never pay back society? Then we, the taxpayers paid for their education for nothing. I think college should be much more affordable then it is now, but not free.",1
25,"The idea that college education would be offered free of charge is an attractive one at first glance. However, as we all know, nothing is free. The Federal government would have to fund its part through higher taxes somewhere; therefore the taxpayers are paying for it. The rest, as proposed by Obama, would 'hopefully' be picked up by the states. That would imply higher taxes somewhere in the states as well. Since many taking advantage of 'free stuff' are not fully invested the long term outcome of self-sustaining independence, my concern would be the lack of accountability on the part of the 'students' taking advantage of the program. Would the professors be to blame as teachers are to blame in the Public School HS now? Because it is funded by taxpayers and states, will the curriculum be regulated so as not to offend anyone and limit free thinking?",1
25,"Sure it could be more affordable, but the purpose of higher education isn't to eradicate poverty or classes, it is designed for people who can benefit from it. Folks just want a free ride for as long as possible. But I doubt the ""entitlement"" generation is going to think it is a swell idea when they are the ones paying for everyone elses freebies. It is very short-sighted to continually give and expect nothing in return. I don't see how it is sustainable. You don't need a degree to give back to society or even be successful in life, likewise you don't need a degree to flip burgers. What of room and board, who feeds these able-bodied adults while they are at college? What of every person who is already saddled with responsibility at age 18? No, this idea is a selfish joke. Only those with resources to live without a job for four years will ""benefit"". Grow up people, high school is over, you had a free ride for 18 years, enough.",1
25,"If college was completely free who would pay the rent for kids rents,food,and gas. Things that all come from loans which are a refund of the school and classified as living costs, if college was free their would be no loans and kids would focus more on work rather than school!",1
25,"First off, look at all of the people right now who don't care and take things for granted. If college was free it would just be another place that people wouldn't care about and take for granted. Making it free won't solve the education crisis. It will most likely make it worse. Another point is that most places can't afford free college. Even if they did make it free, they would have to raise the taxes to keep buildings in order since the buildings don't get money from the students tuition. All those people who couldn't afford college still won't be able to afford it because of this drastic raise in the taxes. It would be horrible!",1
25,"If college was 100% free that further ruin our economy. What would be the point in going to college if no jobs were open? That is what would happen if college was free. Also, free education would only apply to state schools. That being said private schools, such as Vanderbilt University, would not be free.",1
25,Free college would help a lot of Americans have a better life. their are a lot people that are smart enough and really want to do better but they cant afford a college education. It would also help a lot of people get out of debt to live better lives. More than half of the country can't afford a 4 year college tuition.,-1
25,But on other hand i really don't think of a way that school can get money i blame the government they should make education free but compulsory isn't that a better way to help the country grow .But seriously Steve Jobs and others doesn't need a degree and they are billionaire,-1
25,"There is no such thing as free because in order to make college free their would have to be an increase of taxes by 90% to 100% to pay, and cause economy to crash like for example the 2008 market crash. Which was caused by the government trying to make college free the first time which failed horribly.",1
25,"In theory, a free college would be of no cost to the student, allowing them to attend school without having to worry about being stuck with fees long after they even leave college. In reality, the student's tuition pays for maintaining the colleges' attraction. The money keeps good professors as well as bring in good students on scholarships. If college was ""free"" how would the school get money? They could get money from taxes, but then you are paying for college all over again. I say if you want free college, try your hardest in school to hopefully get a free ride.",1
25,"The government would have to pay for it If colleges were free, The government would have to pay for all the things like student loans, Gas, And food.

We don't know what others' lives are like and the best thing that can happen to them is to get a free education and strive to be better in life.

Did my hard work not pay off? Am I not privileged enough? there are plenty of students like me who work hard, get the grades, do everything right, but they just cannot come up with the financial support to go to school. If education were free, it would still be a ""privilege"". You would still have to work just as hard if not harder to get into good schools, plus this is for public schools.

25,Free college would help the 40 million Americans who have student debt. They would be allowed to get a degree and go to college for free. All they would have to pay for would be room and books. You may be thinking that the public colleges would need funding to afford free college. The solution to that is to use the money from grants and financial aid to fund the college directly instead. If there is free college tuition there's no need for financial aid so it would go to the college to pay for all of the classes and amenities. Another benefit of lowering college tuition would be that the private universities would lower their tuition prices as well to compete for the students. College needs to be free because more students are having to deal with the long term effects of student debt and that hurts the economy as well.,-1

No, the tax rates would not increase by 1000000 percent. Yes, you are essentially paying for the tuition of other people if you don't attend college or university yourself, though we already do that (through high school, elementary school). No, once again, taxpayers are not going to be paying 100 times the price of taxes already set in place. Actually, as a result of the increased number of people going to college, the economy would boom, assisting in tuition payments for future generations anyway.

This would be the taxpayers money, the citizens of America, so why not? State colleges should provide education to those with the will to learn, our society will prove that it is indeed beneficial when the standard of living increases from the benevolence that is free college education.",-1
25,"Yes, state college should be free. Free third level education has several advantages. First of all, everyone can attend, so the gap between rich and poor students decreases as poorer students have more opportunity. The economy also benefits from the increased pool of highly educated labor. An educated workforce attracts employers and foreign investments, socially, a more educated population should have more choices regarding nutrition, jobs, and lifestyle. An additional point is that university fees only contribute a small proportion of the university budget.",-1

While I'm not sure how we would pay for this, I believe it would be an expense that would pay for itself in the future.",-1
25,"College should not be free for everyone. First i would like to refute my opponents claim: Point 1: Now I would like to state my points: It takes a lot of money to build a college campus, Pay rent and to provide the students with the facilities they need. If college was free, there would be no money coming in so the college will not be able to sustain. Secondly, College is full of experiences, And one of them, Is learning how to create a budget to save money. Without having to pay for school, This experience will not exist which will be trouble for the person when they are buying a care or a house. Younger generations will not learn how to handle finance. If college is free, College might not seem as important, This may lead to students bunking classes, Because they. Think they are not getting their money's worth, When they are not paying for anything. This current price of college drives students to complete their schooling s quickly as possible so as to reduce debt. Another reason that college should not be free, Is because, If college is free, Then to many students will enroll and the college may not have the facilities to habilitate them all. If college is free, their will be a lot of students who will not be what they should be, Because admissions in their chosen university will be full. With more people choosing to attend public colleges because of their tuition-free status, Many schools will have to create waiting lists or expand the ones they already have, Which will lead to state budgets being strained, Which will lead to cuts and decreased access or the programs students want to take.",1
25,"Let me start off that I am a single mother who will have over $60, 000 in student loans once I finish my MBA. As much as I'd love tuition to be free, I know that comes at a cost of others. In order to offer free tuition, That most likely means increased taxes in some from. And for those who argue public elementary, Middle, And high schools are free - no, They're not. They're paid by city residents in the from of property taxes that's rolled into their mortgage or rent payment. School has never been free, Ever. If you can't afford it, Borrow like I did. there are plenty of people who can't afford college but they borrow. Having student loans is better than not having a college education that might serve as a block to your professional career.",1
25,"If we relied on the government To pay for college the colleges would accept more student, but would accept students that get Fs and Ds so the college would have to change the product to suit the lower students. So the higher educated students would get less out of the college then the would with a non-free college. Also, this puts no limits on how much colleges could charge for admission. A study was don't out of 18 countries with free college tuition 12 out of 18 did not have a higher economic boost. Plus, it would hurt the poorer people even more because living situations would be increase in price and the rich would fill in the spots. there would be no financial support for their living cost so it would but the less money maker people in more debt if college was free. Also, no place to be closer to the college for the non-wealthy. So i say no to free.",1
25,"If public colleges are free, everyone must be running of to public colleges leaving the private colleges (most likely better education) empty. When public colleges are free, the tuition is still payed. However, you know who? You! You are the who pays, but you might be wondering why.

25,College should not be free to everyone. First off who's is going to pay for it the 1% of the rich. News flash they can get out of the country and don't pay all that much tax and just putting a law that charge them to move their companies into international areas won't work because of corruption and also they will find out before it's even taking into effect. Also if the 1% leave we charge middle class and then everyone is going into the low class and then everyone is suffering and many will leave and then the country is broke.,1
25,"it's true that people should dream big, but if future students aren't setting realistic goals, we not only will have students getting free education and spending more time in college, but also lose some of the fundamental technical skill workforce this country needs to survive. The cost of university is no doubt outrageous and the incentives of institutions in the wrong place, but the cost of university is what prevents students from making foolish decisions of pursuing lengthy and sometimes never ending quests to fulfill a degree. Bottom line is that the taxpayer should not have to be the one paying the price for higher education, rather more focus can be put on cutting the outrageous salaries of the tenured professor. The story doesn't end their, just read the book 'Higher Education?'.",1
25,"The idea of ""taxing the rich"" and taxing Wall Street to provide revenue for the ""free"" public colleges isn't real or sustainable. The most basic economic principle is that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Once the money is gone, the burden eventually falls on taxpayers. Sorry.",1

In those countries only the top students go on to high school and from their only the top students go on to college but they have already earned their place. That is affordable. But to say all college should be free for everyone. Impossible. As a public school educator, where students think they are entitled to go on to college for just having graduated need to think twice about public community college. But their does need to be some correlation between after college employment income and repayment of debt.

Here is why it does not need to cost 30k (more like the cost of a care - do you have one of those??): - don't go ""away"" to college and live at home (or with a roommate off campus) - Live simply like - a poor college student - internet, restaurants, cell phone plans and sometimes even a care are not necessities of life - Get a job while you are going to school - great life-experience and many employers contribute towards college - don't go to a ""Top 100"" and stay with a reasonably priced one or online (doesn't really matter in the workplace as long as it is accredited) - Skip ""college"" and go to a trade school - many of them also help you get job placement and financing. - Don't do it all in 4 years - space it out and pay as you go I did it. You can, too. And if you spaced out in HS or had some other issue, there are lots of free prep courses, military service and something called the internet or library that can help you prepare - if you are really serious.

Most students who are being accepted into college can already pay for college but... Who would go to the sixty thousand dollar school compared to the free university. This shows us that the lower class isn't even educated enough to be accepted to college besides a low percentage of the lower class population in which over 80% of students get financial aid in the event that a low class student could not pay for it. Henceforth proving that we need to invest more money into high school before we make public college free in order to educate the populous as a whole rather than the students who are already educated enough to get into college and have the funds to get into college.",1
25,"With completely free college education, comes the lack of endurance. Studies show that people tend to work less when a personal ownership of paying for their activity is not their.

How will the students be able to pay for the college and for their own stuff? So why not have the colleges be for free so that they can learn about how to handle with money and also that they can do their own stuff. What if the students are poor? They would have to work part-time jobs just to earn money to pay for college. Then they might not focus so well. What if they don't have a family?

An educated society is nothing but beneficial for a nation. However, many countries that have all-out free college don't boast the best college educations.

25,"When the supply of a good is too high, demand will plummet. Scarcity gives a product more value, so making college education completely free leads to the labor market becoming oversaturated with workers with college degrees. What happens when you have more college degrees but the same amount of jobs available (or probably even less now that you've just killed entire industries by making them free)? Well, now Joe the Wal-mart exec doesn't have 50 applications anymore but 200, yet he still has the same amount of jobs open. So unemployment increases. By a lot. All the while, you've just graduated with the same degree that 50,000 other grads in the country, whereas if education wasn't free you'd only be competing with maybe 20,000. Good luck finding a job now! But even if we lived in a magical world where jobs were unlimited and bespectacled English boys went to wizard school, what happens to the quality of education in the country when you destroy competition between universities? It drops faster than your momma's knickers when she brings home a hot date on a Friday night. there's a reason why private American institutions such as Harvard and MIT dominate every worldwide university ranking and still do: it's because it is a near-perfectly competitive industry, and competition begets innovation and better service. Bottom line is, if you want your college degrees served to you on a silver platter with no charge, head to Austria and Sweden, where the unemployment rate is 10% for the former and the labor participation rate has dropped to 40 year lows in the latter, not to mention their best universities look like community colleges compared to even American public universities.",1

This point is not intended to negate the assertion that these students deserve some reward for their accomplishments. It is simply so that free tuition is too much.

Because of this, people could be rejecting a person who could be someone else's, and possibly a country's future. People that have potential to be the President, are rejected from schools because they don't have funds to attend it. In my honest opinion, that is just really unfair to some people. Yes, free college may mean more people, and some who don't even study for college, but think about it. A lot of people have matured by the time they reach college (Sometimes high school) and only wish to get educated for the better of themselves and their future.

Since most people can't afford to go to college they don't go and that's why most people work at fast food places and things like that instead of a good paying job that they actually love!,-1
25,They should have free attended state colleges. Some people will go nowhere without an education an might not have the money. Not everyone can get a scholarship to college and it is hard enough paying for college But with free attended college you only have to pay for supplies.,-1
25,We are paying money to possibly go into debt because we aren't guaranteed a job after college. We would be working our whole lives away to pay the debt we got yourselves into. Other countries do this. People who are poor can't afford college so how are they supposed to get out of being as poor as they were.,-1
25,Student have the rights to a decent college don't you think? They can go to elementary and high school for free what is the difference it will give people more high paying jobs in america and open opportunity to the society.You never what people can do with a college education,-1
25,The headline says it all. Charging people to obtain knowledge is morally sickening. It creates greater social inequality and continues the trend in America of the rich staying rich and the poor staying poor. Forty four countries have now adopted free post-secondary education. America needs to think progressively and join the rest of the world,-1
25,"Colleges should be free because the cost, many students say that it's to much and they don't have enough money to pay off school. Many have jobs that isn't enough to help them pay off the tuition and it doesn't do much to pay off the high tuition that they have. I strongly believe that if state colleges was free then many students could pay off other things instead of struggling with school and also many students have kids to take care of and many have bills to pay off because they have a house or apartment they're living in.",-1
25,"The financial burden is the probably the major component to the stress and self-doubt of one's ability to attend college. it's just way too expensive. their are a number of extremely bright kids who are more than capable of doing well in college but who don't have the chance simply as a result of unfortunate financial standing. These are people who could make positive impact and change to our society but who are cast aside because they can't afford to pursue higher education. there's a reason why more and more countries are starting to make college free -- it's effective. I think that it would produce good results. Of course, their will be those ""slackers"" who go to college just to party but they're already in college now! it's typically the privileged kids whose parents are paying their way through college who don't take their education as seriously. Humble people from humble backgrounds who are academically qualified to attend college will not take the opportunity to attend college for granted. College should be free, especially public institutions. there is more than enough money being used for unnecessary things for some of those funds to be moved around to make this happen.",-1
25,"While I understand the people who say it shouldn't, their are some alternatives to what they believe will happen. For example, the most common argument I've seen is that their are too many lazy teenagers who don't take college seriously. While that is true, this doesn't mean that a college can't deny their application. Just because college would be free does not mean that anyone can walk on campus and sit in a lecture. there should still be an application process. there should still be a fee to apply, but the courses should be little to no pay. I understand there are plenty of scholarships available, but applying for a scholarship and winning it is not that likely. I know this from experience. I have at least 10 scholarships and grants right now, and I can say that I still have difficulty paying for all of my courses. I am also actively looking for a job, but as a full time student, it can be difficult to find a job that doesn't coincide with your schedule. I respect all opinions, I hope you guys can respect mine :)",-1
25,"Yes because some people care about school and want to go to college and make something out of themselves, but yes some people are immature and don't care that's why if we make state college free they should have the gpa required for that school then they are more than likely to care. But a grant may say free but is it.",-1
25,"If you're born in that state and have the proper grades of course you home state College should be free to you. I think that you shouldn't have to pay to go to school but maybe for the dorms and books and stuff. Everyone doesn't have the money to get into most of their home state colleges because the tuition is way too high. Like honestly why are we paying all of that money just to go to school? We don't have to pay for high school, middle, or elementary unless you're in a private school or something. It just seems stupid to pay for education if you're doing what you're supposed to do and making the appropriate grades.",-1
25,"Education is the number one combatant against poverty. If we were to have free education people would not be a stressed on how they are going to pay for college. People who can't receive government assistance like my best friend, she would make a wonderful vet! Denmark, and Norway have free education. They are higher up in Math and Science then the USA. Granted their are some people that don't deserve to go to College! If they slack off for only 1 semester then they should be kicked out!",-1
25,"If teacher in high school tell you to follow your dreams but you are not able to pay for college, the high school teachers are getting your hopes up. You shouldn't be penalized for something you want to do but cant pay for. College is just a life setter compared to high school and should be similar in the way it runs then having to pay for tons of unneeded fees. Some college people had no way of supporting themselves their first year in college and should need to stress over finding the money. If people cannot pay for college for a legit reason they shouldn't have to if they are in state.",-1
25,People say no because they already been in college or they have money to pay but they don't think about other people if they do or don't have money. Students will have more better careers so they can support their family and more students would decide to go to college instead of dropping out of high school.,-1
25,"Why not? College students are not lucrative, and most if not all are working part time jobs. Many students end up taking loans, and no, they are not able to pay it off even when and if they find a high paying job. Students should be stress free! Nonsense. I have heard of classmates who ended up committing suicide because of the pressure on their shoulders due to the debt they owe. We want to create a society of great leaders, yet we are pressuring our future leaders to live a depressing life by asking them to pay off their debts for the rest of their lives! If developing countries can have their colleges and universities free of charge, shouldn't we, as ""sophisticated"" countries be able to do that and much more? it's time we start caring about our students. I feel like schools have just become about business. The textbooks are too dang high priced, and sometimes we don't even use the text books enough to match what it was worth. it's not because students are lazy but because teachers don't even make use of their own textbooks. So why waste the student's money? And you know what I love? When it's buyback time in the book store and you get paid such a minuscule amount for the text books you bought HUNDREDS for (note the sarcasm). Seriously! Are we sincerely looking to help our students become future stars/leaders of our society, or are we trying to make life a living hell for them?",-1
25,They should be able to attend for free because what if these people are really poor and want to go to a college that they can't afford. They can go to a state college to get their dream job or to pursue their dreams. Also if people don't get a scholarship and can't afford a college!,-1
25,"When teens who can't afford to get a college degree drop out after high school, they can't afford to support their future family, which cannot afford to support their children, and so on. Free colleges will solve this problem. Smarter workers will help this country's education and economic problems and lead the way to a better future for everyone.",-1
25,They should be free to attend to because many people don't have the money to attend college but they want great jobs but they cant get the money and they just want education. Education should be free to people but not all education is free. Not everything in the world is free like people askes it to be.,-1
25,"I believe that the current generation has had it much rougher than their parents education when it comes to the prices of going to college and the likelihood of obtaining a job from going to college. If schools were free, the enrollment would definitely go up and I think that the country would benefit greatly from having so many highly educated people in the workforce.",-1
25,I think they shouldn't have to pay because of the cost of books. And because no person should be deprived from the education that they want. I also think that everyone needs a good education. And then if you also think about it everyone still has to pay for each unit they take including the units that they have to take.,-1
25,Because it's not affordable to some people for example some people have to travel out of state just to be able to afford a certain college tuition and college fee. Also not a lot of high schools give out scholarships to colleges and that would add up to how much you have to pay for your books and folders. It would be a lot of money to spend for the people that don't have a lot of money .,-1
25,I think they should because so students want to go to college to get a good education for their life ahead but can't because they don't have the money to get a good education and most countries do it also because it is really hard to get the money just to get an education,-1
25,Because every student deserves a great educations so the student can have a great job and a nice career and also they can do what they want in life and they will be very successful both ways but they can always NO MATTER WHAT FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAYS,-1
25,"Our country is so far down on the list of education it's pathetic. The only way to fix that problem is to allow state schools to be funded by the taxpayers and also get rid of the ability to dropout of school when you're sixteen years of age. Private colleges will still have tuition and higher levels of learning so that people can still go to the college of their choice and earn scholarships and whatever else may have you, but soon enough we're going to have an overwhelming amount of people who are uneducated and unable to do anything higher up in the workforce that our country won't be able to sustain itself. And I would much rather spend money for people to become educated then spend money on most of these other taxes that I have to pay for. it's a great idea.",-1
25,I think it's ridiculous that we live in a country where people who want an education cannot receive one because of the outrageous cost to attend college. Teenagers should not have to put themselves in debt for an education. How are they expected to live out on their own? Better education=better economy,-1
25,"They should be free to attend because people can't afford that amount of money a year I mean 30,000 dollars a year come on why not just charge for the food and some people can't get enough scholarships to support them just make it less expensive for people.",-1
25,"Not everyone has the money for a college tuition available to them, but everyone should have an education available for them. I'm 16 and i want to go to college but there's only one problem, money. My family is poor we barely have enough money to eat. I try really hard to keep my grades up but with depression and anxiety that can be hard. I know some people are going to look at this and think that it's just an excuse, but this ""excuse"" sits with me and holds me back from doing things i really want to do. I really want to go to college, but i know i wont be able to. So i believe that it should be free for those who really want it.",-1
25,Idk what that means but i'm going to go to the bathroom now. One time when i didn't go to the bathroom i thought i was going to die! So go to the bathroom when needed so that you won't feel like that. But i also like pizza so toodles,-1
25,"Colleges should be free. The earnings that many students receive from their part-time or full-time jobs have to be given away towards their students loans, and tuition fees, therefore not getting enough money to support them through out everyday lives. Also, because of the high fees, many aren't able to sustain college, resulting in them not being able to attend, and get an education.",-1
25,"It would give students all over the world a new opportunity to learn how to be successful later in life to those who take advantage of it. And if they are not free then students will have to pay off debt later in life, my mom still has debt from college to pay off. And finally, it's so unfair to students who want to do college but they can't afford it, they could get a job but not one good enough to pay for college.",-1
25,Why i think it should be free to go to college that's a good question well some people what to amount to something when they get older and if they cant pay to go to college then they will not amount to anything because they will not have a college degree and can't support their family.,-1
25,Other countries do it and it works really good for them. Why you think there are so many foreigners over here in America making so much money? Doctors? Lawyers? Dentist? They can get a good FREE education and then go wherever they want to make a whole lot of money.,-1
25,"I think state colleges should be free because their are some people who can't afford to pay tuition but want to go. How is that fair to those who can't? it's like the government is saying "" You're poor so you have to get a sucky job instead of one that will help you not be poor."" That's wrong on so many levels that it's unreal.",-1
25,It is important for America to have people attending college otherwise we would crash from the economy. The world is becoming more and more advanced than what it was. We need college to be free and affordable so that we learn what we need to learn so that we can keep up with what is happening and going on in the world.,-1
25,I think that state colleges should be free because not a lot of people can afford to go to college you have to pay for food books and a lot of other things. And if you don't go to college and won't have a job and that leads to no money and that leads to no house and that leads to no food and that means no life,-1
25,"Some of these posts say collage instead of college and there are many other mistakes that people make like mixing up their, their, and they're. Maybe if we made all college free like some countries then we wouldn't have so many poorly educated people in this world we live in.",-1
25,"Most of the students that go to college are either just out of high school or low income and they cant afford to go to a college that needs thousands of dollars for a dorm room or college paid apartment. High school students would not be able to pay that much for an entrance fee let alone a dorm room. High school students want to go to college to experience living without parents, in college they would get a job and have a lifestyle they can handle, paying thousands of dollars for something they would leave in three or four years then having debt is what is going to hurt them ten years after college.",-1
25,Most people don't go to college because they cannot afford it. Some people really want to go to college. People who go to college usually end up in debt. A friend of mine has been out of college for eleven or twelve years and is still in debt. I believe that college should be free.,-1
25,My family is poor and we don't have enough money to pay for college. I think that a lot of people have this problem. Also this country is currently number 2. Russia is number 1. Russia let's people go to college for free. Don't you think that is a coincidence? People don't go to college for nothing. They go to better the economy and country.,-1
25,I feel like school is huge waste because I work as hard as I can and chances are I'm still going to have to pay a huge amount of money every year to go to a college. Plus when there is a more educated society then I feel like their would also be less crime and less people unemployed.,-1
25,Some students can't afford to go to college. How is that fair? I would want to go to college where I want. Other people should be able to go where they want. I say people should be able to go where they want. I vote yes for all the people that can't afford college.,-1
25,Colleges should be free because there are many students that are really smart that don't have a lot of money. Money is just a thing that not everyone has and so it should be free to go to state colleges therefore bright young kids can have a chance to become great in something they really enjoy. Make collages free to help the better of us.,-1
25,College should be free because it will give more opportunities to for someone to learn without paying any debts or thousands of dollars that need to be paid. With more learning it gives people more chance and decisions to make in life and in our communities that we live in now.,-1
25,"Because my parents don't have the money to be paying no $30,000 a year so that I can get an education. Primary and secondary education was free, so should be post-secondary education. It is not fair. All students should be able to attend schools without worrying if they have enough money or if they will be able to apply for financial aid. If that means the taxpayers have to pay more, then so be it. Everyone has a chance.",-1
25,People who have a high enough GPA then they should be given the opportunity to go to a college and should not be restricted by how much money they have to pay for their college tuition. Money should not be an issue for someone trying to help the country by learning.,-1
25,Other countries have free education and it works out very well for them. We should have it too. A student should never have to change their choice of college for financial reasons. This is cruel and unjust. A college education should be available to any capable student who wants it.,-1
25,Because their are a lot of family's out their who can't afford state colleges. So yeah I think colleges should be free to attend! Also there are a lot of kids that want to go to college but couldn't afford it so i think that colleges should be free to attend!,-1
25,"Why should public state colleges be any different that public schools? Because college is not as accessible as public schooling, many people decide not to further education. Financial Aid, possible scholarships, etc., are not enough to help ease the debt that comes with college in many cases. By making college free, we are making education more accessible and affordable to our society, which can only benefit us.",-1
25,"Most people don't want to spend most the rest of their lives paying off tuition and student loans for college. Plus, College students are already paying for housing and food. Why should they stress about having enough money to pay for their tuition too? This is just my opinion though.",-1
25,"there are lots of people that is too poor to attend state colleges. Or maybe there are lots of kids in one family so they couldn't go to college. But if it is free to attend, It would be good for the people who couldn't afford to go or have too many kids",-1
25,"An education should not be priced JUST so you can get a good paying job. Teachers always say ""When it comes to college, You have to put in the work for it"" yea well what if they got all A's and they still did not get in? Exactly. My point if, It should be free. At least give them a chance to try and maybe they will surprise you",-1
25,Because i said so and because i head to do a write thing for school so i had to thing and it took about a day to do and yes colleges should be free to attend why because i said so yes colleges should be for those who don't have money to go to colleges,-1
25,Colleges should definitely be free because school learning is free in most public schools. People shouldn't have to pay to get the education they want to have to become what they want to be. The careers that people choose shouldn't have to be a price. People shouldn't have to pay to follow their dreams.,-1
25,State colleges should be free because colleges are places were students go to learn and if they don't have enough money they won't be able to attend college and they won't receive the right education some people have poor families they could still pay for books and supplies but that's enough for them to pay for.,-1
25,Well kids are not going to college because of the amount of money it cost....That is why most kids don't finish college...That is my opinion what you think guys....And btw you even have to pay more money for food and your second semester.....I agree for to college to be free,-1
25,"I say this because not a lot of people have the kind of money to afford going to college. their are people that want to get a college education but can't go because they can't afford it. Furthermore, education should not have to cost money because it's something that we all need.",-1
25,Some kids and parents don't even have money to get children food so how are they going to pay for college . If college was free parents will not stress looking for money to get their kids into college. I don't think it should be money because some people can't even get a job,-1
25,A student should be able to go to a state-owned college and the students can pay for their books and stuff that is needed for the classes and the colleges cost to much and some of the students can't afford college the prices are to much and the should be free and that way you don't have to deal with college debt,-1
25,Yes because what if a kid is really smart and wants to go to somewhere like baylor and their family don't have the money. All that kids hard work will go to waste and they will start to give up because they know they will never reach their dreams. So yes colleges should be free to all people and to all poor or rich kids.,-1
25,They don't to pay millions of money for state college should be free because they pay for lunch food.People that don't have job's the should be able to go to state college's for pro people so they get jobs and a house money .That why people should be free,-1
25,"Should public colleges be free to attend for residents? Colleges should be free to attend because if some people are not capable to pay for their education this would help them a lot imagine you being them one day your parents tell you we can't pay for your college anymore what will you feel like? That’s why we should make collages free for those type of people this type of thing will help them for their future and for their family’s future not everybody has the chance to go to a collage in mind because maybe they can't afford to go to that collage. So we should give those people a chance to show other people what they can do every person deserves a chance, every person is unique, a lot of people are gifted with great stuff they can do but they don't get the chance to show people what their gifted with.",-1
25,Some people who really want to go to college may not be able to pay for it. And also many more people would have a chance but they should at least make applications for those who are eligible to join. Which can also higher college rates and reach the top of the chart.,-1
25,"State college should be free for all students to attend. First, college is a places where students go to learn. If they don't have enough money they won't be able to attend college and they won't receive the right education. Second, primary and secondary education was free so should be post secondary education and all students should be able to attend schools without worrying if they have enough money. For example if you don't have money to pay for school, that would be sad, and if your parents think is too much money you are not going to that college because of the money. Third, people should be to attend state owned colleges because a person's education should not have to cost anything. A person's education is to benefit himself or herself in the today's society and to benefit his or her's country and economy. So many more people would be able to attend college without the expensive cost. Many people will be without debt or have a way smaller debt because they don't have to deal with college debt.",-1
25,"My family isn't poor but their not rich either and therefore they cannot afford to pay $27,000 a year for a 4 year college that's like a new care each year and that's not even including how expensive food is. College should be free because we already pay state taxes for it anyways it's not fair that some people should be deprived of their education because they cannot afford it",-1
25,If former students are paying off debt their whole life they would have no time too benefit to their economy besides doing their jobs but that's only if it's a job that benefits to economy which their is very few of those so therefore this is why i think state colleges should be free-charbeezle,-1
25,IT should only be free for those people who deserve to go to college like those kind of students who have worked towards getting a scholarship since they began school. Multiple people like myself cant or might not be able to go to college for financial reasons. No matter how hard I work it is still going to be a struggle going to college because of money so if the people deserve to go to college it should be free but if they slacked their entire school life then they should have to pay.,-1
25,School is free from pre-k to 12th grade but that’s not enough college should also be free because it is the most important grade. And if you don't go to college because it costs to much you won't get a good job which isn't good for your family that’s it.,-1
25,The prices of tuition is outrageous! Only people from higher classes have no problems with it. It’s not fair to the lower class who want to go to college and can't afford it! It’s understandable to have to pay them but the amount of money that they want us to pay is crazy. The prices for everything goes up but our paychecks get dropped!,-1
25,I think this because there are many people in the world that want an education but can't get it because they don't have the money to go to college. If state colleges were free to attend their would be many more people that aren't homeless and have really good jobs.,-1
25,"If it isn't free you won't be able to get a job so you won't be able to afford college. For example if you don't have money to pay for school, that would be sad, and if your parents think is to much expensive, you're not going to that college because of the money, so i think colleges should be free for everyone who needed and for someone who want it, and of course for someone who wants to go more further then they are.",-1
25,"If you want to ""Make America Great Again"" an idea, that has been shown to be successful in other countries, is by at least taking the steps forward to making college free. We waste so much money on the government anyway we can get our money's worth and do it",-1
25,"As everyone said above, everyone should get a fair chance in this world, and college is no different to primary or secondary schools, it runs the same way. If people want a good education they can pay the extra to go to a private college, but for people who don't have much money they should get a chance at doing something great in the world and not let money hold them back.",-1
25,"Sure schools like Elementary or Middle School and High School cost money, but not as much as college! And college is the most important learning session of your life! Being free doesn't mean we just let any teen attend. If the are that dumb just pull them back a grade and teach them a lesson.",-1
25,College should be free because most people don't get enough work hour to afford college or they can't get a job because everybody knows that it's hard out their and sometimes you can't do anything about unless you stand up. But sometimes it doesn't work.And that's why i think college should be free but me i don't even know how hard the world is im only 13 but we can still try to make state colleges to be free,-1
25,I think that colleges should be free because sometimes there are people not from here that are in high school and come here to be someone in life that's why I think that they should have free colleges to attend because I guarantee you that half of the country is going to be attending college I asked by friends and we had a talk and we said that we should be able to do that not just for some people to go but give the opportunity to some people that want to attend...,-1
25,"People need to know things if they want to have jobs or get a degree! If people don't go to college because they can't afford it, then who will replace the people who already have degrees when THEY retire? This is why I believe that state colleges should be free.",-1
25,College Education should be free because it gives people a chance to get a degree and make a difference. It gives and chance so people can show their talents. The more businesses are made and the better people can be. The better America can be. That is why college education should be free.,-1
25,"Education has become very expensive. In order to get a job you need a good education. Some people don't have the money to pay for college, which means they wouldn't get a good job to take care of themselves. If college was free no one would have to apply for Federal Aid.",-1
25,People who attend college to fool around obviously they will be kicked out of the school and the people who don't fool around actually get educated and get good jobs and the people who did fool around will work In a store and think twice about going to college for fun and idiocy or to get a good job and live the good life,-1
25,Hi my brother is the king and I love you so much he makes me happy for you so much please don't be so happy for me to follow you I would need you so much more than anything else is that you can get it to the point where it would not,-1
25,They should be free because as some people have said some people can't afford it and it would be hard to pay tuition but with free colleges they could get a good education and get a great job to earn money and have a nice life SO I AGREE COLLEGES SHOULD BE FREE!,-1
25,Why would a college not be free to attend i mean why should you have to pay for education to get educated or to get a education is your decision you should not have to pay and what if you homeless and for the people that say no because people who really don't like school go and waste space for people you want to if it happened to you sorry but that's not true why would they go to college and they don't want to.,-1
25,"If state colleges were free, millions of people living in poverty would finally be given an opportunity to receive a college education. Millions of students can't continue onto college due to their financial situations, and free college education could open them to a whole new world, breaking them away from the cycle of poverty, giving them the chance to change their future.",-1
25,Children that are poor or are living on streets eating food out of garbage could finally be able to go to college and get a job and get food and a house and maybe a care and have a good life then dying from hunger and need food it would be nice the college can get money from the state,-1
25,"If a poor person goes to college gets a job and becomes a doctor their whole family has just benefited they can buy better food their children can eat health and get educated because that person just save about 10,000 to 50,000 dollars because of free colleges. So yes college should be free.",-1
25,Some people can not afford it. People need a chance What if you are really smart and don't have the money If the colleges need money why don't they use donations Make everything as cheap as possible The teachers shouldn't be their for money they should be their for teaching,-1
25,"I think they should be free because for the students who want to attend. If you don't attend college it lacks your education. Also important jobs like lawyer,doctor,vet ect need four years of college at the most and if you don't attend you are unlikely to get the job.",-1
25,"it's sick how all these rich people comment no but the people without the money are the ones commenting. I think everyone should have a chance no matter what.

No let's use it for college funds, instead of things that don't need the money.",-1
25,"If college is free, that is giving many people a chance. It is also giving the poorer families a chance. there would be requirements though. One would have to attend all of their school years within that state. This is also giving more people a chance to become smarter, and get better jobs instead of be a nobody in life.",-1

25,"Most families and students have big decisions when it comes to college. And nine out of ten times, they probably have to include prices in the decision making process. What if I told you that every state college was free? Wouldn't that make it easier? For example, if you wanted to be an amazing doctor, and School A had an outstanding medical program, but School B was a few thousand dollars cheaper how would you choose? But if both were free that’d make it a little less stressful. If state colleges had a free education program, that requires you to hold a certain grade point average, it would make taxes higher, yes. But being able to go to college for free (you still pay for dorms, food, etc.) would enable you to get a higher education level, making it easier to get a better job, giving you the chance to make more money, be more successful, creating more, jobs, making you able to pay those taxes.",-1
25,"Yes, college should be free, the reason why is because this is our country we need to be smart people and well educated and not have to pay to learn if we are willing to try hard to get a good education, it's for the good of our economy whether or not we are well educated.",-1
25,"If high school and elementary is free. Why do we pay for college? it's the same thing except we get a degree that determines our income. We pay for our homes, food, clothing and other expenses. Education should be free. If you've lived in the state for all your elementary and high school time you should get to go to college in that state free.",-1
25,"College is a choice that a student has, and if they choose to go to college, then they should not have to worry about being in so much debt because of tuition prices. Maybe college shouldn't be totally free (such as paying for room and board), but the price should be extremely more affordable to bear with.",-1
25,"there should be no cost for education, because some people can't even afford it and if they do they would probably only do it for one year. Why the hell do you even have to pay for college? It should be free for those who want and education and those who want to succeed in life.",-1
25,"College should be free for those who want to attend but cannot afford the thousands of dollars that schools charge for an education. Colleges would still make money by selling books, parking passes, spirit wear at sports events , etc. for these reasons in state college tuition should be free.",-1
25,"Colleges are areas where students come to finish their education and also colleges are officially where students start their lives, especially if students want a specific career in their lives without colleges we really wouldn't have much more of an education past high-school, even then so, not all students get through high-school. So in my understanding state colleges should be free for the majority of the part",-1
25,"I am not saying that college should be 100% funded by the state but there's no way that 22,698 students all paying $29,150 (and that's only the in-state tuition. Out of state is $47,166) is required for salaries and basic upkeep. That's over half a billion dollars per year. The student to teacher ratio is 16 to 1 so I believe students are grossly overpaying for a college education.",-1
25,"I think this because as i know many people disagree, that is probably because their parents had the money to support them, so they disagree. I for one am a person where my mom doesn't have a bunch of money to support all six of her kids. I believe that if you are in need of money and can't try to go to college because of financial issues, then college should be free.",-1
25,Heck yeah college should be free. We have a gap between rich and poor that's growing in the United States . A lot of people in the US don't have access to higher education. Which leaves kids that don't have the money for college and want an education that cant get one.,-1
25,"United States students spend in average almost $30,000 a year to attend university. Whereas most of the european colleges are free or cheap. More than 70% of graduating students are in students debt with a loan over $25,000. This is 43.3 million Americans with student loan debt, this is $1.23 trillion in total United States student loan debt. Education is a fundamental right a shall not be disclosed to anyone because they cannot afford it, education makes you free, because you are only free when you have the knowledge “Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance.” Will Durant",-1
25,"The federal government currently spends approximately 69 billion every year on financial aid, grants, and tax benefits to low-income college students and grads. Essentially, the government is using this money to make expensive college affordable. So if public college was free, the government would have this extra money leftover. Free public college would only cost the government 63 billion, according to the Department of Education. it's simple math guys. Free public college will enable newly debt-free grads to better contribute to the workforce and be consumers, improving our economy.",-1

25,"College is a bunch of crap and it is so much money and if it is free, people will want to go. Not all mothers will give money to their sons or daughters. #freecollege America heck yeah. it's a free country. College for life just do it free college don't let your dreams be dreams.",-1

25,"The argument that free college would make the degrees obsolete is exactly the point. We as a country have turned college into competition to see who has the higher degree. That's not what education is about, it's supposed to be about the pure attainment of knowledge. If you have all the same qualifications as someone with a higher degree and score equivalent or higher on a placement test for a certain career then you should get the job. That does not happen though because we have forgotten that the entire point of education is to educate. People complain about being in poverty but most of those people have very limited educations, from either not being able to afford it or not taking education seriously enough during adolescence. Those people should be able to reconcile their mistakes without being limited by their social status of being poor. The way we as a country can grow and prosper is by educating those who have lesser educations. If we educate people crime will decrease substantially, their will be less people in poverty because their will be more people able to do the jobs that require a special training. While i agree that college is not for everyone the alternative would be vocational schooling. Give those people who are not suited for college the ability to hone in on a specific skill and master that skill so they can be a productive member of society. To better our individual lives and the nation as a whole educate the people.",-1
25,Having a free college tuition can help a lot of students in the future. For example it would help them get a better job and help us in the future. Also a lot of people who have brilliant minds who can't pay for their college because they are poor and can help us in the future.,-1
25,If kids were to go to a expensive school they would have to work from a young age and have to save every dime they can. They don't need to work from 7aM to 10pM It interferes with their school work and they need to be able to live their childhood and not just work,-1
25,"State college should be free because, we give children education only up to 12th grade. Students need to go out and branch on education more. If they have to pay a tuition fee which is a lot of money per year at a college, how will they get the chance to actually learn if they are going to be stressing about paying for college? So yes, college should be free because we want children to become more in life and sometimes it won't happen because of burdens that will get in the way.",-1
25,People that want to go to college may be poor and don't want to get loans because that will make them more in debt. So I think that colleges should be free to attend. I think they should have a meeting or something and decide on it. They should say yes because some people that are poor want it and some people that are rich don't want it because they think that their mom or dad will pay for it. Well guess what honey they won't be their forever. So go to college.,-1

Also it cost 62,000 dollars per year for taxpayers just to keep one person in Jail, which is likely where they will be if they don't have a solid education. The average family makes 52,000 dollars a year. The taxes take away most of it and they have to pay for an average 60,000 dollars for college? Come on America! Obviously these families will be in debt. Getting a student loan doesn't help either since if you declare bankruptcy it won't rid you of your debt. Most college seniors when they graduate have an average debt of 26,000 dollars. Plus %8.8 don't have jobs. How are they supposed to pay of a debt if they can't make money?! Even countries like Germany have free college. Even Apple CEO, Steve Jobs thought college was too expensive when he dropped out. Even if it isn't free college tuition prices should at least be lowered!",-1

My point exactly is that college should be free to attend so that way if you are unable to pay for it but are able to attend then it would be much easier for them.",-1
25,People should be to attend state-owned colleges because a person's education should not have to cost anything.

So the total cost of free college in this country is over 400-800 billion dollars. Now this might not seem like a big deal but it is. The federal government has to make up this money. How are they going to do this? Tax the citizens of the United States Yes the tax rate would explode if state colleges were free.",1

Plus, there are 50 states, and if their are a few colleges per state, that is 100 universities with a couple thousand of dollars per each pupil, and pay the teachers and other staff, it's too much, which is why colleges do cost money.

Early education, primary and high school because that would do more to ensure kids from poor households can actually do well enough in school to be able to apply for university in the first place. The cost of university is not the main reason poor students are not going to university.

In addition you could just do great in school and try to get a academic scholarship.,1
25,Taxes will be extremely high became the state/ government will spend all their money on colleges. Also the state wouldn't fund things like road repair. As great as it would be the economy would suffer from it. The students will be lazy knowing that they are not paying so their grades will not be as good as dedicated students. This will bring down the colleges in stats based on how successful the students are.,1

25,No because the state still has to pay for it and how does the state get money? Through taxing their residents. Germany has colleges that are free of tuition and they have a 45% taxing rate. It really sucks. Would you rather pay 45% for the rest of your life or just get a scholarship and pay a large one time fee only?,1
25,"It would cost so much money to replace, repair, and buy supplies for the college. A lot of people would be going and it is a very high level of education. Therefore, I think college should not be free. Also there would be a lot of germs and microorganisms going around when illnesses do.",1
25,"If college were to be free we would probably see a increase of college goers, which is great. But are they only going because it is free? I totally understand that college is a lot on money, I get it. However, you could get loans that help towards college. If it were to be free their is going to be people wanting more and more. So, I believe that it shouldn't be free due to the fact that people will just take random classes with no future in site. I ask, how fair is that to those who have a purpose for college?",1
25,So you don't want to pay for college but you're going to make me pay for it. Also it is not fair for people who work hard that some lazy kid can come get college for free. EDUCATION IS A PRIVILEGE NOT A RIGHT. Let's think about word before they come out of your mouths ya liberals.,1
25,"In any school, in the United States, you have kids/students that just don't care about their education. But you do have the kids care care and would like to go to college. And I am one of those, and the fact that I have to pay for college pushes me to work harder to get an education. If you get rid of that students will not try as hard as they can to get into college. And if you do that you will have lots of very useful supplies being wasted on the students that don't care. So why not let the caring students have all of the supplies they need. Plus, without the income from students to the schools, teachers, and Professor's pay will most likely decrease. Then you will have teachers leaving the schools.",1
25,"I am fourteen years old and I think college is a privilege and you should need to work for it. Lots of people are saying they should be free because some people can't afford it but if you can't afford it, most colleges offer a way to help you afford it such as: grants, scholarships, financial aid, and loans. If colleges become free then anybody can go and not everybody cares about their education so why let people who don't care go. Also how will the professors be paid if college students don't have to pay. Professors won't be paid and they will quit to find a job that actually pays them.",1
25,If they were free then how would people be paid that work in a college get their money. If people don't get paid they quit and if they quit nobody learns anything and if they don't learn they cant get a job do you really want you kids to be pour and not aloud to get the job they want,1
25,"In the long term, are you really getting to go for free? No. No matter how convenient free college may seem to a child or a teen, adults should understand that money to pay for college won't just come out of nowhere. Nothing will ever be free. You will pay.",1
25,"First of all who is paying for this? The state? Where does the state get their cash? Oh yeah, taxes... So we are paying for kids who we don't even know if they are going to stay in college, or if the will flunk out, we don't know. Also everyone should have to work just as hard as someone else to get into college. At first I was like: ""YEAH!! FREE!!"" But just stop, stop and think about these questions before you vote: Where is the money coming from? How are we paying teachers? The polls show 80% yes 20% no, come on guys, just think before you vote, think.",1
25,"No because people will just fool around and leave when they want to and if you pay you will value it more because you paid it with your own money and you won't leave you would stay and learn and wont drop out and you can have a better education and have a perfect job and maybe your own business, so pay for college.",1
25,"There are many adults that say that they should've gone to college. But that was their choice to not go. Then the other half of those people say they shouldn't of gone to all those parties, but still did. it's a stupid thing to let inexperienced people go into a school and join just to think it's easy even though it isn't",1
25,"The college would not make money. First, there would be no sports teams because the college couldn't pay for it. Second, there would be no college because their wouldn't be enough money to pay for the college and food too.Those are my facts on why college should not be free.",1
25,"No, there are too many slackers in college for the partying already. If state colleges were free, it's reasonable to assume every aimless teenager would attend, whether he actually wanted to learn anything or not. Colleges already offer huge grants, making college very affordable to students who have shown strong academic ability and the focus to use what they are taught. Also, loans are readily available to make college possible for students who need them. Loans encourage students to understand that college is not a chance to party in togas without your parents grounding you, it's an investment in your future. We need more students to take their college education seriously, not more students who want to party and don't feel like getting a job.",1
25,"So if state colleges are free then where will the money come from for teachers and school materials. All free college will do is raise the taxes of the working class citizens. Since they are paying more, they will buy less causing inflation. The only people who benefit from this are the rich people.",1
25,"College is anything but free. Who will pay that 30000 dollars for every year of college? If you are smart enough you can get a scholarship into college. Even if college is free, it's not like everyone can finally go. Most kids from poor families have to work anyways and have bad schools to go to. They would have an impossible time trying to get it. Meanwhile, all the people who would get in normally and can pay would just get in normally for free. Taxes would be so high it would be terrible. Also there would be no minimum wage workers if everyone could go to college. College would become impossible to get into now that literally everyone is applying. Only the most top tier 4.0 - 4.4 students with super high SAT and ACT scores would get in (like me :) (cough, shameless self promotion, cough)).",1
25,People should work for everything in life and not have it handed to them. It makes everyone in the us weak if everything is handed to them. If you had a kid would you want them to get everything handed to them if that were the case my kid wouldn't go to college,1
25,NO college should be free because the taxes may rise and many families may more then usual and the families won't have money to afford food and survive my opinion is that State colleges should not be free at all theirs some websites of colleges that you pay less instead of saying let state colleges be free cause you are not the one who well be affect families well.,1
25,"Free college would be a major step back for the American economy and would only increase taxes, so in the long run colleges wouldn't be free, even if you chose not to go to college you would still be paying for others college and would that be fair? No I don't think so.",1
25,"there are many other ways for kids who don't have much money to attend college. For example, scholarships, programs, and military provide a way for kids to go to college who really need the help. If they truly want to go to college and receive an education, they will work hard for those scholarships. If it was all free, many people who don't really care will just go and waste our money and resources.",1
25,"College is hard to pay for when you are in a low income family, or even a family with no income at all. America is a land of opportunity and everyone deserves an opportunity to succeed. The rich and the upper class need to do their part in helping young people succeed. Education is not only good for you, but it's needed for advancement in our society.",-1
25,"I know about the taxes but if you want to go to college and you don't have the most money like me, it's dumb for us middle classed people to be buried in debt. College is like going to a private school, if it's community it should be free but books could cost money",-1
25,"Students who want to go to college shouldn't have to pay for their education. Some students have their parent help, and that's barely enough. We've had free education throughout school. Why start paying for it when you get to college? Yes we had to pay for EC activities, but that's so we could go on trips and get the equipment that we need. I understand paying for the dorms, because we're just renting the rooms so we can live on campus and have time to get ready in the mornings. Instead of waking up 3-5 hours early just to have enough time to get ready and drive to school. So many people who want to go to college can't because the tuition is too high, they lost their job, or they just don't have a good paying job. So yes I think college should be free.",-1
25,Kids need a free education because they will not want to go to school. A lot of kids can not afford college and will not get a good job when they get older they will not have enough money to support their families. That is what I think about having free college,-1
25,College should be free to everyone.Every school should be free actually. You should not have to pay for something that will help you make a living. You should not also have to pay for something that you are capable of doing so. You should be able to try to make a company.,-1
25,"Everything in life has a price, and that includes education. I think it would be great if we could have a system where education, as much of it as we wanted, could be offered to the public free of charge. But until taxpayers and government leaders start valuing knowledge above funding the military, it's not gonna happen.",-1
25,"Going to college should be free. It should definitely be reduced from its current rate. Right now, most high school students are not even thinking about attending college because they nor their parents can afford it. I think something should be don't to lower the cost so everyone that wants to go should be able to.",-1
25,A lot of people don't do to college because they don't have money to go or stay in college. Some people don't have good jobs because they don't go to college. They just work at burger king or McDonald's. If more people go to college more people are going to get good jobs. Plus if college is free people will not have to be on debt until they pay all the money!!!!!!!,-1
25,I think that making a college education free would be a good idea. The United States is falling behind other countries because our educational system is not focused on the right thing. Many colleges and universities are too concerned with making a profit. Some other countries provide free college educations.,-1
25,"Yes, attending college in the United States should be free for anyone who wishes to go. As grade school and high school are free, so too should be our institutions of higher learning. It is tragic that many don't get to attend college simply because they lack the money.",-1
25,"If college was free, it would allow motivated students to attain a higher education regardless of their financial situation. This would create better workers in general because students would be interested in the subjects they studied. there is no replacement for a motivated worker rather than a worker only in the field for monetary gain.",-1
25,College should not be free. If college was free then the people of america would go in the red just like it already is. If america had a president worth anything and was able to balance the budget then maybe america could afford to send everyone and their mom to college. But they cant. Taxes are already high enough if they can't balance the budget the3n their should not be free college take out a loan or apply for financial aid.,1
25,"If the government begins paying for college, the taxes will be raised and will cost us even more money. If college is free, so many people will attend and do nothing with the education. College therefore can not be free as to avoid these very troubling, financial and people problemes.",1
25,"College should not, and cannot, be free, because it would cause a tremendous financial strain on an already-strapped government. That being said, deserving students who do very well in high school can qualify for needs-based scholarships and grants if unable to afford college. Not all college aid needs to be paid back, so some people can get a more affordable education that way.",1
25,"Accredited schools should still charge, because it is a motivation to students to do better in college. As is, many students don't strive to learn as well as they should in college. They need motivation, a carrot at the end of a stick, but in which the carrot can be eaten after four years.",1
25,I think education should be free because people around the world are poor and cannot afford education therefore they cannot go to college and they can't get an education and then if people don't have an education then they won't get jobs and then they won't be able to pay off their houses and they won't be able to pay the state either or debts,-1
25,"Collages are costing to much money and some students don't' have all that kind of money 30,000 dollars is to much at least some people try to qualify for collage. Also some parents use their money for bills. Like light bill water bill and gas bill. That's why colleges should be free",-1
25,"No matter how amazing free college sounds, somebody has to pay for it. Sure, the first place we would turn would be the state, but where does the state get that money? You. Me. Every taxpayer this side of the Canadian border. ""Free"" college cannot exist. Sure, the student might not be paying while they're in school, but later on, the money will be taken from them. Okay, sure you can pay for college later, but how does this help people who choose to not go to college, or can't go? It doesn't. By making college ""free,"" the government would effectively be forcing people to pay for another's schooling.",1
38,"The priorities of big business are less humane than small businesses. They operate on an expectation of a certain profit and all decisions they make are based on that one priority. A big business may appear to be friendly, ethical, and care about it's employees and customers, but making money is it's one bottom line, and they are ruthless in pursuing that goal.",-1
38,"The larger the company the more influence it has. If people were actually literate in the information they read and understand then many things would be different. Wealth reflects exactly how much power you have as a person in dictating change or stagnation. We're seeing history repeat itself as big business and corporations focus on how unions are bad. I agree their can be ethical big business, But unethical big business especially the richest ones with the most influence are deterring progress and only in it for themselves. The whole argument of whether climate change does or does not exist was fabricated by Exxonmobil. The biggest oil company found out it was a thing and then kept it quiet. Over the years they created discord about the topic that has turned into what it is today.",-1

Also many big corporate love to abuse consultant vendors at cheaper countries (like India, Philippines, SouthEast Asia, Africa, Or abuse the part-time workers skip benefits, Instead of paying their company workers proper wages and benefits or promoting within. Also stagnant wages for lower level workers, While upper management's keeps the biggest bonuses and $$ to themselves, While ignoring suggestions from lower level staff. Many big corporate bosses prefer to push their current employees to work more and harder with less pay and resources, Instead of hiring more workers to relieve burden, Ever-increasing job pressure. I myself experienced several layoffs in the IT field, Many times the bosses uses ""market downturn"" as reason for mass layoff, No job security for lower level staff.",-1
38,"Take Home Depot and Arthur Blank as opposed to locally owned businesses. The market for these things is their whether it is a home depot or a local owner. The difference is that wealth from all over the country is not flowing into one man's pockets but thousands of locally owned businesses who also would likely pay their employees better. The result is overall greater economic impact for the local community. Why does hundreds of millions pouring out of Georgia, or millions out of a local community and funneling itself to Mr. Blank help our communities.? Because we now have the tagline, ""Let's do this!""....I think not.",-1
38,"The bigger the business, the more susceptible it is to become bad. As business expands, their are a lot of factors that could possibly hamper and would lead it to become economically at risk. Factor such as competition is more present in bigger businesses that it is in the smaller one. Also, big businesses would have the problem in terms of planning, organizing and possibly, staffing. Take for example is the sole proprietorship and the corporation. The former is easy to start with because it doesn't need a lot of qualifications. On the contrary, corporation is difficult to start with because it requires a lot of people and it deals with larger economic businesses.",-1
38,"Big businesses take over the country. The owner of a big business would get hundreds of millions of dollars, but their workers only get a tiny portion of that. The working conditions of big businesses often are poor. Big businesses might create jobs, but it can also take away jobs.What about the person who wants to start a company in a specific field, because that's that person's gift. But their was already a monopoly in that field, so they would be hopeless. Big businesses put smaller businesses out of business. Also, the quality of products isn't as good. Dunkin Doughnuts is pretty much a big business now, but in the beginning, their doughnuts were REAL. They were made that morning by a human being. I've been to small pastry shops that serve real doughnuts that are AWESOME. And also, big businesses can bribe politicians! And what if a big business dominates the country, and then one suddenly fails financially, then the whole stock market could crash!",-1
38,"We seem to rely on big businesses to provide for many of our needs. In other words, they have a little control over our lives. In a big business where one person owns the entire company or has a controlling share, they get the final say in everything. This does not sound like a democratic model to me. It is a dictatorship, where one person controls everything. The customers buying the products and the lower employees, who are the backbone of the business, don't get a say. it's easy to say ""oh we just won't buy your products"" or ""we won't work for you."" But when every single business starts following the same model, one has no choice. They are subject to the whims of these big name companies and people.",-1
38,"Big businesses are not good, because they are increasingly getting more and more profit by selling necessities to all the people who are in need. They are in need because they don't have much in the first place, thus spending more of their money, thus more profit to the bigger businesses.",-1
38,"No, big business is not necessarily bad business, as long as it's ethically run and allows for some level of care about it's workers. their are examples of big businesses that are exemplary (Wegmans, for example), and some that are not (Walmart). Likewise, their are small businesses that are run poorly and treat their employees poorly, so it can't generally be said that one is bad or good.",1
38,"I have never been given a job by a poor person. I work for a water utility, treating water. It is big business but a non profit, supposedly. Anyway, without big business, ie, people with lots of money, the labor market would fold. Unless everyone worked for the government. We're would the money come from to pay these government workers?",1
38,"Many larger companies employ vast numbers of unskilled workers. This can be a very good thing for many people. Teenagers getting their first job or ex-felons trying to earn a honest living. For many the dilemma of needing to have experience for a job, but being unable to get experience without a job is one that most people go through. Those hired may be under-educated do to unfortunate circumstances, and have had trouble finding a job in the past with many smaller business. For many larger companies, they have the resource to train many of them to work. The fast food employee or bagger at a groser is often the first job for many people. A job where they can learn the ropes and gain valuable work experience for their resume. Yes, they may not make much, but that is the unfortunate price they have to pay. At least many of them are given the chance to move up in the company, thus improving their wage. I have personally met and have worked with many of these people as well as understand what they have gone through. Most teenagers don't care for their first few jobs, but for some they are grateful for the fact that they got the job despite having a rocky past. The opportunity that many smaller business are unable to provide.",1
38,"No, big business is not bad business, because all of the businesses that are big businesses had to start out as small businesses and work their way up.

38,"Should we punish those who are successful? Businesses that spread beyond their owners garage or basement or wherever they start should be encouraged as they are obviously doing something right. With efficiency comes success and the ability to hire more employees thus creating more jobs and allowing the business to expand. What the owner does at this point can be decided as good or bad. Do they treat their employees as equals or do they attempt to make as much money for themselves as possible ultimately undermining both the business itself and employee morale. I think the question itself is too vague to be answered simply. Big business has more of an opportunity to exploit nature, the law, and it's own employees but remember that without big business none of us would have gas, electricity or the various electronic devices we are all reading this on.",1
38,Big businesses usually lead to failure in a long run. Too big of a business means the cost will be bigger and the competition will also be bigger.

38,"While I will agree that many big businesses are bad, whether that's in terms of environmental issues, employee issues, consumer issues or what, there are many good things about big business. Large businesses have the power to influence the way we think, the products we use, how business is conducted, how employees are treated, and in other ways. Whether it's using employee ideas, promoting only from within to give more opportunity for advancement, or providing large benefits packages, a big business' influence can be far reaching with it's employees, as opposed to corporate greed. Ethical, thoughtful actions can benefit not only the big business, but the entire world. Which, when don't in a moral, supportive way, is a good thing.",1

38,"Even though Walmart gets 80 percent of its goods from China and is the largest employer in 23 states, overall the world's largest retail chain is good for America.

In general, a cheaper way for Americans to shop is good for everyone's bottom line.",1
38,"Although I do believe Walmart is the suppression of many ""mom and pop"" stores and the fault of them going out of business, it is a wonderful asset to our country. It is a place of socialization and convenience. Many people have opted to online shop now, but Wal-Mart allows one easy trip to find the essentials. They also provide millions of jobs for our country in this economic depression.",1
38,"All the opponents of Walmart attack their prices and their employee compensation. Look, we live in America. No one is forcing people to shop at Walmart. No one is forcing people to work at Walmart. The majority of the people that are against Wal-mart are people that don't even shop their. Let me tell you something from a man that has to provide for his family. Wal-mart is a God send! This place has saved me numerous times. I know I can make my paycheck stretch their. This is the reality we are facing. It is good for the working people of America because it allows us to provide for our families. I know all the rich people have enough cash to shop anywhere they please... We don't. If you get rid of Wal-mart you will see a very big difference in America - Millions of people would be out of work, and millions more will be struggling with rising food prices. Like I said...

But take note that if you are a frequent Walmart customer, try to compare their prices with other stores that sell the same items, you will soon realize that they are NOT CHEAP store as what the TV commercials says so.

Walmart also allows convenience for the people shopping their because Walmart has a lot of things that a lot of the shoppers need, so they don't have to go to other stores to get what they need.",1
38,"Walmart is good for America because not only are their locations everywhere, they have affordable prices on products that are a necessity for life. Many people shop at Walmart because of this and also because this SuperCenter is supplied with all basis of life conjoined into one building which saves time, gas, and effort.",1
38,"I believe Walmart is good for America, because it gives a variety of things to buy, and most of their items are at a reasonable cost. Also it saves your time only having to go to one store instead of multiple, stores. it's a very convenient store for almost anyone.",1
38,Walmart can be very good for America in that they have very low prices. Also many people can benefit from these low prices and it can be very efficient because it is a one stop shop. Such a large company can create many different jobs for many people around America.,1
38,"Walmart, although has poor wages, is overall beneficial for America. They provide incredibly low prices, which gives poor Americans the opportunity to purchase the basic necessities that they would not otherwise be able to afford. Wal-Mart has a wide variety of merchandise that can support low income families. They provide people with jobs who are not trained at a higher level, such as a college education.",1
38,"Of course, it has low prices and more then you could ever want to buy. The only bad thing is that their employees don't get paid enough. My opinion is that if you don't like the pay, you don't have to work their. Get a better job somewhere else .",1
38,Walmart is not good for America because it hurts people more then it helps people. The wages the employees receive are very low and not fair among everyone. Their prices are low but the prices are often advertised differently then what it truly costs meaning Walmart is ripping the local people off. The big Walmart stores destroy local communities because the local stores cannot compete with the prices of the Walmart products thus forcing the community stores out of business.,1
38,"I support the argument that Walmart is good for America because, it provides reasonable offers for the ""lower class"". I believe that Walmart provides the best for your buy when it comes to groceries. It also provides automotive services to customers which is very convenient while shopping. Although I believe that Walmart is good for America, there is a bit of competition between Walmart and other stores as far as entertainment supplies. Wal-Mart tries to compete with other local stores by placing lower priced items beside higher priced items that seem reasonable. This causes customers to be persuaded into buying the more expensive item that seems like a better deal, making their profit rise. I also believe that Wal-Mart is wrong for paying their employees low salaries, yet if you need a job bad enough, I guess it is what it is. Overall, Walmart is very beneficial to the ""lower class"" with their prices and variety of products.",1
38,Wal-mart is able to be a convenient place to shop for people. it's a place where you can walk and find anything that you might need due to the variety that the store is able to provide for the people. People don't have to go to other stores in the area and hop back in forth between them and waste time when they can go to one convenient store that is basically guaranteed to be in the area due to is widespread company.,1
38,"Walmart is very cheap also has diversity for families. They sell everything from gardening supplies, to groceries, to medicine, to small pets. The convenience is unbelievable. The workers don't get paid well but let's be honest; what else are we gonna use? If you don't shop at Walmart you're going to make 4 trips to get what you usually need and spend way more money.",1
38,"Even though the employees don't get paid well, and the workers that make the products get treated poorly, we hardly have another choice. If we want electronics and everyday things, Walmart is the most reliable place, and you can get everything you need their. Walmart isn't great, but it's better then nothing.",1
38,I think so because it's very helpful to people all around and Walmart has everything you could possibly need. A lot of good sales and quality are given at Walmart. there's so much variety to choose from which makes it better than any other choice. Going their can eliminate going other places and saves time going to one place.,1
38,"I do believe that Walmart is good for America because, Walmart does provide jobs for those who need them. Also, Walmart, is convenient for having almost everything you may possibly need, in one building. Their price are also quite affordable for some people who can't afford to go elsewhere.",1
38,"Wal-Mart is a company that improves the life of Americans across the country. It has low prices and incredible variety which allows many residents in underprivileged areas to buy what they need. The argument that says ""Mom and Pop"" stores suffer is over exaggerated in today's media and in reality many stores continue to operate at normal.",1
38,Wal mart is a huge company run by capitalists. Just because some minimum wage workers with no skills can't get a lot of money their doesn't mean the capitalists that run the country can't profit off of it. They exemplify the American dream of making a lot of money and everyone else is just jealous,1
38,"I say yes because they have low prices and they have every thing that you might need but, if it is like wood or things like that they just might not have it and that is why I say yes on the DEBATE but, if you go to walmart to find something and they don't have it then to bad for you.",1
38,"As we know, when workers don't earn enough to survive and support their families through their job, they rely on public assistance programs to make ends meet. That’s what public assistance programs are for. It’s good that they’re their. But what that means is, if firms are using those programs to function as subsidies, as appears to be the case in Walmart, that can put competitive pressure on other firms to do the same, which overwhelms the public sector.",1
38,"Here are some things to think about the next time you go shopping. Wal-Mart offers prices that are good for college students and affordable to anyone that decides to shop their. They pay about the same amount as a fast food place, and most of the stores even have a fast food restaurant inside of them, generating more jobs for Americans. They sell all sorts of products in the same location, saving gas waste emitted from cars and allowing customers to spend less time driving. At the Wal-Mart in the place I live, they even have a hair salon. Wal-Mart is friendly to the community and makes America better.",1
38,"Having a ""supercenter"" is not only convenient because of the variety of the products sold their, but the prices as well. Many people in America are living in poverty and it is convenient for them to be able to buy the things that they need in order to survive. it's also open all day, 24/7, which is also really convenient.",1
38,"With today's poor economy it's great that I can stretch my dollar. it's more important to help the masses then to help a few small business owners with high prices. They also employ people in wheelchairs. And for the people who complain about working their, they are free to find another job. We live in a free society.",1

38,"IS WALMART GOOD FOR AMERICA? One can't go anywhere in the US without finding a Walmart right around the corner. Walmart is the ideal store for America; it’s cheap, accessible, and to simply put it, it gives consumers exactly what they want. How much better can it get? A family just moved into a new town. They're on a budget, and need some supplies: mom needs some plastic food containers and needs to buy food, dad needs some paint, the teenage daughter wants some headphones, and their son is sick and needs some medication. Of course, in this town their is a Walmart. The family can make one stop to Walmart and get everything they need. Not only can they get everything they need, they can get it all for a low, affordable price, perfect for their budget. This is the best thing about Walmart-everything is in this one store and is cheap; it simply does not get better. The consumer gets what they want. This is the “American” way. Let’s be honest-like any other country, America is selfish. It’s all about the US, the US, and the US. We're so worried about not being “American” and helping another country's economy. China is Walmart’s largest exporter. However, it’s reasonable to have China their largest exporters. It’s cheap and convenient to have China produce products due to the fact that their workers aren't paid a lot. However, critics see that products that aren't produced in America is unAmerican and that all we're doing is giving China more power since their economy has bettered due to the production of all these products. People don't realize that if we would hire people to make products in America, we would have to pay them minimum wage at least, which would in result not give the customers the prices they want on products since the prices would have to increase. And so what if we're helping China? Isn't that what we should all do? Help each other as countries to achieve peace and prevent wars. One reason we wouldn't want to create conflict with China is because they make most of our products. With Walmart stores all over America and still multiplying, job opportunities are open, therefore helping job rates. A new store, needs employees. their you've hired a good amount of people. Then there’s not only that store, there’s a whole bunch of other new Walmart stores with more employees, increasing our job rate, therefore helping us. That’s another reason people can't complain; Walmart may not providing factory jobs in America, but they are providing jobs in the store which may even be better. American people serving other citizens in Walmart is wonderful idea.",1
38,"I have never purchased a bad product from a Walmart, all of their products have been of the highest of quality. Also there is a very wide variety of foods and other goods. Also, their is the point that there is a guarantee that if you don't like the food, you can return it to the store.",1
38,You can save money on food and clothes and you don't spend 100 dollars and people are happy that they don't spend 100 dollar you can spend less and you can walk out of walmart happy. You think you spent 100 dollars but you don't. I love walmart that is why i chose yes,1
38,This Company is taking advantage of everything they can. They don't pay workers what they need to survive and then they tell them to get food stamps and other government help. The home office doesn't care about anything besides themselves. This is almost like the Nazi's coming in to set up concentration camps across America but many are too blind to see it! They say history always repeats itself and it is happening as we speak and something must be don't!,-1
38,it's not the low prices that they say it is. They do it just to get you to buy the thing that they have marked low. it's higher then what they mark it at. So it's a waste of time their and you're waiting forever in the checkouts just to go somewhere else.,-1
38,"It devalues goods and puts many small business out of business. It makes us dependent on cheap disposable goods. The corporate employee system is also very stifling, little chance for advancement and one of the most depressing places to work on earth. Also an oppressive place to shop, and generalizes everything into a generic formula. We need to invest in America and American made goods.",-1
38,"No, I don't believe Walmart is good for America. Thousands of small business owners have seen their dreams of being successful entrepreneurs destroyed by the opening of Wal-Mart in their area. Small businesses are not afforded the same discounts by wholesale providers as those given to major corporations because the smaller business cannot buy the massive quantities that companies like Wal-Mart can. Therefore, they must charge higher prices for the same product thus losing patronage. Most employees of Wal-Mart will never realize their own dreams because of the system that the company has put into place as far as raises and promotions are considered. Just to be considered for a full time position that offers benefits to the employee, you have to be employed for an extended period of time.",-1
38,"Though Walmart provides many jobs for Americans and offers low prices on their products, they have put many small business which communities thrive on out of business. This over time can have a negative effect on smaller towns that rely on the revenue to stay strong and prosper.

38,"Walmart's pull factor, lack of competition, and widespread, is only cause trouble to the American Economy. When a business needs to find a store to sell their products in, the only real choice is Walmart. Since Walmart is a one-stop-shop, people don't need to go to another store to get what they need. This makes it far to difficult for other stores to compete. The pull factor also plays a role because it limits what businesses are allowed to make, since Walmart will step in and say that they will only sell what they want on the shelf. Then to get hold of cheaper labor, they would tell all the production businesses to move all of their operations to China. The last big factor is the low prices. Low prices is concocted to low payment. With prices as low as Walmart's, the workers are most likely being paid below the minimum wage. All of this only leads to the crumbling of the American Economy.",-1
38,"I know that Walmart creates many jobs and gives families who are more in need of low prices but I think Walmart should take down some of their stops.

Yes Walmart create many jobs but in doing so they destroy more jobs then they make.

While it's nice to get cheap products from foreign countries like China, what happens to the average American worker when we don't have good paying jobs?

When are we going to wake up and realize that not only is the middle class disappearing before our very eyes, but so is the American Dream.

So you sell the store but you then end up working at Walmart and they pay you less. The good thing is that in brooklyn their are less walmarts and those big stores.

I got a coaching when I had 4 occurrences on my attendance while another co-worker got 8 occurrences before they said anything to him. I will sometimes shop at Target just to spite Walmart. This evening I had to close the shop alone, then they should have had another Tech on duty with me. They always keep us at a skeleton crew and we struggle to keep up with the work.",-1
38,"Walmart started out actually helping people, but you can now see how much that has changed. From paying off people to get their stores built without getting the proper permits to underpaying the people who work for them, Walmart is no longer the American company we can be proud of. When the taxpayer's are subsidizing them billions of dollars AND also subsidizing their employees, because they won't pay them enough to live on it proves that they have abused their employees and the American taxpayer. I find it funny that their are people who actually look up to companies and people who abuse them and the rest of us. Walmart gets $1 BILLION in tax breaks and $607 MILLION in preferential tax rates. $6.2 Billion in public assistance programs because Walmart does not pay a living wage. That totals $7.8 BILLION the taxpayers are giving to Walmart. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Hushed up a vast bribery campaign that top executives of it's Mexican subsidiary carried out to build stores across that country, according to a published report. In an identical economy, how do we explain Costco’s growth vis-à-vis the failures over at Walmart? Here’s a crazy thought—might it have something to do with the fact that Costco pays nearly all of its employees a decent living (well in excess of the minimum wage) while Walmart continues to pay its workers as if their employees don't actually need to eat more than once a week, live in an enclosed space and, on occasion, take their kids to see a doctor? And just in case the occasional Walmart employee finds a way to squeak by, the company has sought to put an end to that by cutting their employment roster by 1.4 percent, even as they increased their store count by thirteen percent. Walmart fills their own pockets with taxpayers money, while not paying their employees enough to make ends meet and the taxpayers then pay when the employees get food stamps. How sad is it that during the holiday season Walmart put out baskets, asking people to help feed their own employees? Pretty damn sad! Yet some people don't care. I guess they don't care that Walmart has bribed people to get stores built. THAT IS NOT A GREAT AMERICAN CORPORATION!",-1
38,Walmart turns huge profits by buying from china. However the money is isolated as is with any company at the top. It isn't circulated and gradually over time the living standard can't keep up with it all as more money is sent to china to turn a profit here for the few and not the many. Eventually it will backfire. Nice debate though!,-1
38,"They create many jobs yes, but their wages are so low that many Walmart employees can't even afford walmart's medical insurance. Do the calculations and see how you could support a family off of $15,000 a year? The answer, you can't without the use of government support. Walmart uses subsidies to create their stores and then gives back very little to their community. In fact they probably take more from the community through their employees need for government aide then they give back. Walmart as a monopoly so strong and so controlling over not only their employees, but any business trying to compete. it's a monopoly much like that of the Carnegie steel company in the late 1800's. If you don't know what that is look it up. While you are looking that up look up their practices overseas in china and India. If you can stomach what they are doing and still support them by buying any of their products then maybe you have a spot waiting for you in their corporate world. it's sick how badly they exploit human beings, communities, government 2103441125, and court rooms. there's a reason their prices are so low and yet have profits so high. Do your research into the life of a southern plantation owner and what argument they used. Then look at the treatment if their slaves. it's very similar. Yet America still shops their. Why? Because of the millions and even billions of dollars that Walmart spend on their public image. With that kind of money they could actually have built a strong company image in a respectable way like giving a lot more back to the communities they destroy and the employees they abuse.",-1
38,"This Company is taking advantage of everything they can. They don't pay workers what they need to survive and then they tell them to get food stamps and other government help. The home office doesn't care about anything besides themselves. This is almost like the Nazi's coming in to set up concentration camps across America but many are too blind to see it! They say history always repeats itself and it is happening as we speak and something must be don't! it's not the low prices that they say it is. They do it just to get you to buy the thing that they have marked low. it's higher then what they mark it at. So it's a waste of time their and you're waiting forever in the checkouts just to go somewhere else. It devalues goods and puts many small business out of business. It makes us dependent on cheap disposable goods. The corporate employee system is also very stifling, little chance for advancement and one of the most depressing places to work on earth. Also an oppressive place to shop, and generalizes everything into a generic formula. We need to invest in America and American made goods. Thousands of small business owners have seen their dreams of being successful entrepreneurs destroyed by the opening of Wal-Mart in their area. Small businesses are not afforded the same discounts by wholesale providers as those given to major corporations because the smaller business cannot buy the massive quantities that companies like Wal-Mart can. Therefore, they must charge higher prices for the same product thus losing patronage. Most employees of Wal-Mart will never realize their own dreams because of the system that the company has put into place as far as raises and promotions are considered. Just to be considered for a full time position that offers benefits to the employee, you have to be employed for an extended period of time. In 2013, United States trade deficit was nearly $40 billion while China's trade SURPLUS was $260 billion USD. Walmart demands producers to produce at such insanely low prices that it forces their hand to move to countries like China and other Asia countries outsources jobs and putting skilled United States workers out of business. Chinese workers make about 50 cents an hour and work in horrible conditions to the point where it is a human rights issue. Walmart does not employ skilled workers but unskilled workers that they can pay less. Wal-Mart also constantly breaks the law by hiring illegal immigrants for less then the minimum wage (usually janitors) and has been facing sex-discrimination lawsuits since the early 2000's, and breaks health and safety regulation laws.",-1

Not local places/farms putting little businesses out of business (mom and pop shops) The CEO of Wal-Mart makes more in a single hour then a full-time Walmart associate makes in an entire year. Checkout lanes rarely open,-1
38,"I don't believe Walmart is good for America. Wal-Mart is one of the largest employers in our country, however the majority of employees don't make a living wage and many more are not even offered full time hours. I also think Wal-Mart strives to monopolize smaller markets and runs people out of business.",-1
38,"Do you think Wal-Mart execs want to help people, and that's why they have cheap prices? If you said yes you are like most people. It takes a more economical look into the business practices to realize the true answer is no. Wal-Mart wants to perpetuate substandard living because it supports their business model. Employees can't afford to shop anywhere else because they don't make enough to do so. Manufacturers of quality goods are not allowed to sell through Walmart because they only buy the cheapest products in enormous quantities. Even the cheap manufacturers are sometimes left out because they can't compete against the Chinese government who subsidizes their own companies to win overseas business. Wal-Mart is exploiting capitalism to it's most frivolous aspects in the hope of solidifying buyer confidence. their is a line from an old song that rings in my head every time I'm asked to consider the impact of Wal-Mart. ""Saint Peter don't you call, cause I can't go. I sold my soul to the company store"" from Tennessee Ernie Ford's song, Sixteen Tons.",-1
38,"Walmart underpays and over works employees. their have been reports of worker abuse, child labor, unpaid labor, hiring of illegal immigrants, failing health and safety inspections and even locking employees in the store overnight. Walmart takes away business from local industry. They don't provide enough full time jobs, and often attempt to cut corners on spending by downgrading employees to part time, just so they don't have to pay for healthcare. This results in long check out lines, unstocked shelves and dissatisfied customers.",-1

Though Walmart provides many jobs for Americans and offers low prices on their products, they have put many small business which communities thrive on out of business. This over time can have a negative effect on smaller towns that rely on the revenue to stay strong and prosper. When Walmart comes into a new community it often sucks the area dry and once it starts to see a drop in profits it leave a huge waste of space that no one can use or maintain. Many other jobs will be at risk when Walmart establishes new buildings.",-1

The problem for America and Americans is much bigger then just having to deal with insanely greedy US companies.",-1

38,Corporations are a product of the state. NOT MARKETS. They indirectly create monopolous factions of the market and give an upper hand to those businesses that are granted corporate status. They CAN lower prices of goods. . But what consumers don't pay in the CPI they end up paying with their tax dollars bailing out the corporate interests of duplicitous politicians. Capitalist purists and progressives can come together on this argument and agree that corporations are unfair to the average American.,-1
38,"Reading the answers on this debate, I couldn't help but to notice their were two kind of people giving answers. On one side, people who support corporations are eloquent and effective in the way they word their response. On the other side, people who think corporations are bad or 'evil', have very poor writing skills. This indicates that the position you hold on corporations and your level of education are strongly related. Most people with a low level of education think corporations are bad and most people with a high level of education think corporations benefit to society. Personally, I believe that in order to state an answer that can contribute to our society, you must first educate yourself to get the tools to do this. In other words, as most of our population is poorly educated, the answers are biased on personal experienced. -Olivier Chartrand",-1

38,"Greed is a general human trait, in practice since time began. Power generally increases commensurate with growth of a corporation's size and monetary value. Power and money go together to create conditions (creation of favorable laws etc.) where greedy actions can be accomplished. [This doesn't directly relate, but I have never understood in a country supposedly created ""by and for the people"" why 5% of the people have 95% of the money.] Most people seem unaware that the founding fathers of the USA were very much aware of the dangers of corporations and limited their lifespan. To put it another way, corporations were allowed for a specific project; once completed the corporation was disbanded. They were never intended to exist in perpetuity. As others have mentioned, corporations exist solely to make money and a lot of people feel they have no responsibility to contribute to society. Although they of course, take everything society has to offer - roads, schools, military defense, lobbying for every possible tax break. It is hard to know if corporations do good/charity for public relations or because they have good motives. Probably both since few things in life are 100% one way or the other. With all the privacy laws and such, I don't know if there's ever a way to truly know for sure whether corporations do more harm than good. And obviously that answer is not even clear since definitions of harm and good are variable. But to go back to the beginning of my statements here, greed and power almost guarantee that they do more harm than good by any measure.",-1
38,Corporations are groups of people making decisions which doesn't bold well for an individual leader to come forth with a vision on how to run the company because everyone has to be on the same page. Other times companies will start off with a leader that has a vision such as Nintendo or Sony but wind up falling apart when the big rich bankers get their hands on it when they decide to get loans to expand their enterprise. In fact corporations view personal projects on a *reward/risk* based scenario unlike a leader with a vision and love out of their heart for that project. For example the entertainment industry such as big Game Corporations eg: Sony/Nintendo/EA Origin/Steam.Etc are part of the *group* think where someone might have an unique idea but it has to fit within the group framework or the ideal will be pulled immediately. That is likely why the GameCube changed names from The Dolphin which was looked at as more serious at first when the next system after the N64 was first announced but no demos yet. In fact the GameCube emulator you can find online is called *Dolphin* based on the original code name which does both Cube and Wii roms since the Wii's infrastructure is based on the GameCube. Same with XBox and Xbox 360 they come out with great ideas in the beginning to stand out from everyone else but eventually corporate rule will decide what decisions make it to reality and which ones are too *risky* for their system so to play it safe they copy each other hoping to make their version of the product *better* since it's safer then coming up with an entirely new concept they could lose millions. Instead of outright punishing big evil corporations we need to think like they do and get them to feel rewarded for doing what's right and morale for humanity since they won't know they are doing what's right and moral while they are doing it. They will see it simply as return profit while we benefit from the education campaigns that the government produces to educate people.,-1
38,"Corporations just dominate the market, make people dependent and then screw us over. Just as easily as the Corpies give, they can take away. And they rule on fear, while providing us with junk and try to withhold from the people if they don't do as they are told. They have destroyed our whole society, with half the people being overworked doing meaningless jobs, or the rest unemployed. They are a disgrace to america, and must be destroyed.",-1
38,"there are countless legal cases where corporations have paid compensations to governments, institutions to clear off criminal offenses. Unlike individuals, criminal law punishes citizens for wrongdoings that corporations have also attempted. Just because corporations have more economic power and political ties, it doesn't mean corporations can not be punished. I wonder if creating a corporation would make me a better citizen because i can break the law and still pay off some good judges.",-1
38,"Absolutely. Corporations have 3 motives. To grow like weeds, to always make greater profits, and to ""look good"" (not necessarily be good). And they do these things at the expense of the worlds citizens and the environment at great cost. In successful corporations, a few people make money hand over fist way more than they can or should be able to spend. And millions of people are scraping to get by on barely livable wages.",-1

Bath robes, soap, shampoo, makeup, shoes clothing, underclothing, water, juice, coffee, beer, food, computers, phones, cars, printers, bicycles.... Without corporations we would be living in the same state as our ancestors - a standard of living that we would consider abject poverty by modern standards.

38,"I think part of the culture that is anti-corporation is centered around the giant ones. Those ideally if they are that large become monopolies, unfortunately the powers that be tend to not prosecute or otherwise put the watch dogs into place to prevent this. Corporates in general are not bad and do far more good then bad when you take into account that the reason for a corporation is to separate oneself legally from their business, most corporations are incorporated small businesses and small business is always good for a community. it's when a giant starts to stamp those out that we have issues, buy something from a local store if you have issue with the big guys. Personally I end up doing both, for quality vegetables I go to the local grocer and they are usually competitive price. For other items like coffee I tend to go to larger stores because I am froogle. Corporations exist so say someone who had a great idea wants to start a business around, legally separates himself from the business and then can sale stakes in the profits to be made so he create prototypes or buy supplies etc. So the vast majority of corporations are not evil, it is the large ones that technically are not legal as they are for all practical purposes are the issue. Go after the Apples and Walmarts if you want but leave the other smaller corporations out of it.",1

Plus many of them don't provide fair policies to protect their employees from work related mistreatment.

They work together as well, as wages at the bottom remain standard between companies, thus not allowing movement for a better life. The economy is rough as it is so just having a job is good, but it limits your options, easily allowing a corporation to take advantage. Profits continue to soar with no raises for those at the bottom. Common decency would be to help those that help you.

39,In 2017 the BBC's income from Scotland was £323. 7 million. it's expenditure in Scotland was only £222. 6 million. This leads to a expenditure as a percentage of income of only 68%. This ratio of BBC expenditure is lower then in Wales and NI where it spent upwards of 92. 3% and 88%. It is No wonder that only 52 percent of people in Scotland had a favourable overall opinion of the BBC compared to 64 percent of adults. BBC big Whigs hope to eventually up expenditure to 80% but that still leaves Scotland trailing behind everyone else - this lack of ambition and progress simply isn't good enough for Scotland and I therefore advocate for the abolition of a public BBC in Scotland.,1
39,"The BBC has an institutional dislike of white males. Every role vacated by a white male is being replaced by a female or a person from a BAME background. I understand there was some redress required but this has been over played. Even the BBC's own statistics have shown this. It appears every show now has to have 's strong female lead. In the year of the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote this was rightly highlighted but their was no mention of the men who also were previously disenfranchised winning the vote. I understand the BBC wants to reflect the population as a whole in it's content but is this actually fair. their are distortions in demographics with a higher proportion of younger people being of an BAME background. Are the percentage of women seeking work the same as men? Different professions are populated by different ethnicities. The medical profession, Chemists and self employed traders are well over represented by people from an Asian background and the soft arts are gravitated to by people of a while heritage in higher numbers. . This is a reflection of cultural differences not necessarily racism. If you were to look at the background of young children doing theatre or dance compared to taking maths and English or even cricket versus say rugby this would amply demonstrate this. To then introduce quotas in one field and not another is discrimination. Too often the BBC allows jokes and criticism of white males where it wouldn't dream of doing so against any other group. During it's news articles about men of mostly of Pakistani heritage gang raping young girls the BBC would always end their articles saying their were more white male paedophiles. Even when discussing the cultural attitude to such rapes. The BBC didn't use percentage in those caveats. It goes without saying that the BBC only employs left wing comics in anything to do with current affairs. The one occasion I did see a comic from the right on Nish Kumar""s news report he was challenged on every statement unlike the previous left wing comic who was given a free platform.",1

39,"Ultimately, I don't disagree with the fact that shows like the Apprentice and The Bake Off seem to be ethnically diverse to an almost forced extent, I don't see the key flaw in this. Though the whole point of gender and ethnic equality is to have equal and not superior representation in all field of work; media is an essential key to encouraging this, The purpose of these shows is to represent a britain which is accepting of all kinds of people, Are we are willing to put them at the forefront of our television which is meant to reflect what it is to be British. In this way, It actually helps break down barriers and builds tolerance among most white viewers who get to see the personalities of those from different cultures and hear their perspectives. For example, Muslim Bake Off Winner Nadiya Hussain has helped break down skewed media depictions of all Muslims as terrorists. Another key thing is empowerment and how when watchers young and old who are from BME, Minority or female origins will hopefully see role models for themselves in those like a female Dr Who, Fleabag or Killing Eve. When it comes to almost outweighing men, This is not only completely untrue, With most shows still being dominated by a male cast, But is not what our focus should be. I apologise for being a low-key feminist here but, As a general truth, Younger and older men don't need to be empowered to the same extent as these disenfranchised groups still victim to so much more inequality and abuse. Having established what the BBC's high levels of diversity are achieving in terms of empowering minority or oppressed groups in society, Sending out to them and white viewers a message of tolerance and acceptance, It would surely be a complete and utter tragedy to see this thrown away just because of a basic principle of equality. When it comes to ensuring there's equality between men and women both in major industries, We have to make somewhat of a 'sacrifice' here to achieve it on a larger scale. The proposition are unable to see the bigger picture, It seems to me.",-1
39,"Obviously, When discussing the idea of inequality, their can't be double standards where we get so PC that men are the ones who are shouting for equal representation in the media. However, The reason the BBC makes such an effort to increase representation in this media is to create role models for the masses of British people who watch these shows. Young people from BME background and young girls will see these 'heroes' of television and feel inspired to strive to follow in their footsteps of being strong and empowered since these are the groups who continue to be the most oppressed and need reassurance that they are at the forefront of Britain's conscience. This is so essential now more then ever within the current right-wing climate which seems to hate all things muslim or Jewish or having immigrated from elsewhere. If the BBC, A channel that represents UK media, Portrays them with so much respect, They'll find more respect for themselves. For example, Shows with strong female leads include Fleabag and Dr Who while shows such as the Apprentice and Bake Off have been criticised for their overkill on minority representation. Not to be a low-key feminist in this area, But we cannot deny that Generally, Men in this country (though not all men), And all over the world for that matter, Are much more secure in themselves and their abilities because of society having conditioned them in such a way. it's surely perfectly reasonable that we prop up those who need it? We are sending out a key message and, Ultimately, their are still a shit ton of Male-centred shows so I think they'll be fine.",-1

Jobs would have been lost in greater numbers because businesses could not raise the capital to invest and grow, or in some cases, even meet payroll. As jobs were lost, consumer spending would have plummeted even further, leading to the loss of still more jobs. A downward spiral was in the offing, and government spending to boost demand and confidence, create and preserve jobs, and promote banks' lending again was a reasonable reaction to the worst crisis since the Depression.",-1

39,I think at the time the bailout was initiated the country was still stalled. It gave people hope and that jump started the economic rebound. their is still a way to go of course but optimism has recovered for the most part and that is what ends recessions a lot of the time.

Some storms you have to take preventive measures, whereas others you simple can just ride out. This was not one of the storms that you could ride out. Also, it is not like President Obama all of a sudden came up with the idea himself. Don't people realize that their are teams of economists who have studied for years and years in order to help assist the President in making decisions and coming up with plans. The president is just the ""face"" behind many people who are working hard to ensure that the US remains a strong global leader in today's market. This plan was a good start that will lead to the improvement of the economy, however, it will take time. Has anyone ever heard of a snowball effect. It starts off as a small ball and as it rolls down a hill it becomes larger and larger. President Obama's plan has slowed down the snowball but it will take years of good policies and most importantly Americans coming together in order to push this ball back up the hill.

39,"The last depression in US history was caused mainly due to lack of credit. Bernanke and Paulson pushed for the $750 billion bailout so banks would 'lend' and investors would feel comfortable again. Investors felt better, but the banks lent out less money then any time in US history, the markets continued to decline, unemployment rose to over 10%, millions of families lost their homes to foreclosure and Wall Street banks that got the bailout money paid themselves a record $135 million in bonuses with that money, bought US Treasury Notes and bonds and thereby loaned the same bailout money right back to the same government that provided them the money! And in the end, all the banks were merged creating 10 US banks that now hold 77% of all US bank assets.

39,"In 2008, the United States government crafted a bailout plan to steady a teetering economy. Although a radical solution was required, the methodology of distributing the funds have not corrected the basic problems that created the crisis in the first place. The Treasury distributed the funds to the same corporate entities that caused the crisis, with lack of regulation, poor lending practices, and an alarming standard of rewarding greed with monetary bonuses. Rather then assist average Americans with keeping their homes, or creating jobs, the monies helped shore up banking institutions, without any requirement to change the practices that caused the crisis. Furthermore, their have been no prosecutions of the main players that allowed the unethical lending to go on. Now, a few years later, consumer spending and joblessness have kept the recession in place, while bankers continue to earn million dollar bonuses.

39,"I fully support that when large corporations are in trouble, the government should financially aid them. However an assessment of the national economic damages that a corporations bankruptcy may produce will be vital in order to justify whether a bailout is legitimately justified. A massive corporations bankruptcy, if large enough, may have adverse effects on the economy such as; raising national unemployment rates dramatically, reducing GNP and GDP output and possibly influencing a devaluation of currency among many other direct and indirectly related negative effects...The severity of these adverse effects will ultimately depend on the size of the corporation at hand. Corporations large enough, from such an integral part of a nation's economic house of cards that when bankrupt, could partly or fully collapse the rest of an economic system. And indeed when it does, the effects are not only felt in the corporations home country, but also around global markets as with the 2008 economic crisis.

Besides, governmental support makes the government a safety net and an easy chair. It says to the business ""I've got your back, don't worry, relax."" So of course they don't.",1
39,"Why should the taxpayer be forced to pay for a business that has failed them? The company has failed for a reason. They have failed due to either overcharging consumers for their products, underpaying their workers, incompetent and negligent management, or a combination of the three. We, the taxpayer should not be forced to hand over our hard earned money to a business that clearly does not care for its consumers or workers. If a business is guaranteed a bail out, then the management is likely to continue it's risky behaviors. After all, we judge risk on what we can potentially loose, and if the answer to that is 'we have nothing to lose because the government (taxpayers) will bail us out every time we fail' then management will do everything they can to make decisions that make them rich, and not decisions that will please their consumers and non-management workers. Don't get me wrong, there will be a number of businesses that will treat their bail out as a wake up call, and they will usually fire a number of incompetent managers and really turn their business around and go on to generate a lot of business tax for the government and create many jobs in the process, however, I feel these business are few and far between. Due to the nature of humans and their greed I feel that many business would simply feel that they are now in a truly privileged position, and in a win-win situation. If they business thrives then they make money, if their business failed then they make money as they are bailed out every time forcefully by the taxpayer. This to me is one of the biggest scams to have existed ever. We should rid ourselves of such bail outs, let the businesses that have failed us die out and let their competitors fill the void they have left behind. If these businesses do die then jobs will only be lost temporarily. New businesses will be created in that sector, existing businesses small and large will expand due to a huge competitor becoming bankrupt. This means that many 'new' jobs will be created, although they ultimately won't be new jobs in the sector, simply jobs replacing the jobs lost in the business that failed us consumers and workers. This type of system would be hugely beneficial to our economic system, and taxpayers money would also be diverted elsewhere and put towards something more meaningful and helpful within our society.",1
39,Businesses are around to serve the people and if their is demand then their are sellers. If there isn't enough demand for a company's product then they should not be around anymore. It does not matter the size. The government should not have the option to pick which businesses get support and which ones don't. If a business goes down then it goes down. All of these business that got bailed out are zombies and if you were looking for an apocalypse then here it is.,1
39,"You should never bail out or nationalize a company that is failing. You should look at the reason why they fail, they fail because not enough people want their product, because they overpriced/underprice their product. This is the reason why they fail and why they should fail. They don't work efficiently enough and need to be replaced by another company that can do this efficiently, by bailing them out you are supporting insufficient work and you actually destroy jobs or prevent the creation of jobs.",1
39,"The government has a right to protect the people of their country, and by bailing out the banks, they are allowing the people of their country to take out mortgages for homes, get loans for things like education and cars, and allow people to keep all of the money they have saved over many years",-1

39,The US government actually made money off of the bailout. Since in 2014 it was all payed back. TARP revenue has totaled $441.7 billion on $426.4 billion invested. Yes the government was authorized to spend 700 billion on the bailout but on 426 billion was spent. It was not a bailout but more of a loan.,-1
39,"You need to have governments bailing out these companies because if they didn't, tons of people would lose their jobs. Imagine if the government didn't bail out the big US banks. Where do you plan on getting your mortgage? Where will you get a loan to buy a care? Nowhere.",-1
39,"Without these bailouts large financial institutions that are bound to collapse will not only fail but cause a chain reaction of failures in the industry resulting in a devastating effect on the entire economy. Yes, banks acted recklessly and it isn't the government's responsibility to bail them out but for the benefit of the economy the government is, in my opinion, obliged to.",-1
39,"Governments have the responsibility to its people to not allow the economy to plunge headlong into disaster. If that requires helping banks and financial institutions from collapsing, then it should be don't. This should be considered a loan, however, and be paid back in full, and possibly even with interest. Whatever loopholes, corporate greed, or poor business practices allowed them to fail in the first place need to be changed to ensure it doesn't happen again.",-1
39,"If a business should not be rewarded with funding from a government standpoint from failing in society. If a business fails it is because it had not complete its purpose in society. On that note, government officials should not allow business to be bailed out for failing in society and people should stand against this to ensure United States' economic stability.",1
39,"Bailing out banks desecrates the capitalist principles of our country. Banks are like any business and should not be saved if they fail. They don't deserve special treatment because they are ""too big to fail."" In fact, bailing them out only makes them bigger. Sure, the economic fallout may be bad at first, but sometimes you have to endure chemotherapy to cure cancer.",1
39,I think that those who made their fortunes from the industry should have had all the property and wealth confiscated. They and their families should have been conscripted until such time all the debt was paid. They should be sent to defuse IEDs if they don't meet their Debt Reduction Targets.,1
39,"Although people here argue for the free market, I think the banks should have been allowed to collapse simply in order to break the cycle of this free market. In a wider context the financial sectors of the OECD have become extremely saturated oligopolies and no OECD economy exhibits any notable productive economic activity or utility but instead all generally tend to rely on promoting unsustainable external international debts, unjust enrichment and asset stripping in other economies through forced privatisations and otherwise simple theft through illegal warfare. This free market has to be stopped altogether or will result in a very nasty world war eventually.",1
39,I think the government should not be bailing out any business in the private sector. Private capitalism is part of what this country is built on. When they start bailing out businesses then the line gets blurred and you wonder who else they are going to bail out. My tax money should not go to private business.,1
39,"It is important as an investor to know any money in a bank will be returned to you, hopefully with interest. It is also great as a home buyer to know banks are willing to take risks on giving a mortgage to someone with bad credit. However, bailing out banks rewards them for behaviors which put investors at greater risks. Bankers benefit, because they get bonuses from the bailout. The people who had bad credit, but qualified for loans get punished, because banks let them borrow more than they could afford to pay back. The investors suffer, because the interest rates go down, though at least they didn't lose everything. Sometimes even the banks suffer, because they have to sell houses which has now depreciated in value.",1
39,"In Australia, Holden has received $200,000,000 from the Government. The care industry is struggling and they expect the Government to save them from their own ineptitude and treat the taxpayers like an ATM machine. Either Holden should move production overseas or die. The same goes with banks in the US. If they hadn't been bailed out and if key board members went to jail, they would change their ways. Otherwise by bailing them out, you are encouraging them to keep doing what they were doing before.",1
39,"The greatest thing about the United States of America is our freedom. We have the freedom to make choices, whether they be good or bad. All businesses have this same freedom. It is not the government's place to step in and save a business because they made poor decisions. The government is not our babysitter, and it should not be used as such. We must all be responsible for our actions, not wait for someone to come and bail us out of trouble.",1
39,"Although I understand why banks were bailed out by the federal government in 2008, that doesn't make what happened the correct thing to do. Bankrupt banks would have sent shockwaves through the United States and Europe, likely leading to a second Great Depression. However, in a free market economy, those institutions should have been allowed to fail and other banks would have risen to the top of the financial heap.",1
39,"Some companies are too big to fail, and they should receive government bailouts. But if, and only if, it can be proven that the company can be returned to profitability. When a company employs tens or hundreds of thousands of workers in a single country, letting it go under can have severe consequences to the economy and national morale.",-1
39,"I have to admit, I am torn on this one. Yes, they should help companies save jobs. But does that mean that those same companies should get a fat check and only the higher ups get richer, while the guy down at the bottom of the food chain is struggling to make ends meet, only getting 24hrs, while somebody sits at home sipping martini's? No. I think that the government needs to take a closer look at the financials of the companies it bails out, to see where it might cut the fat so to speak. Yes, these companies are their to make money, but there's a bigger picture and if I run out of money to pay my bills, I am expected to fix the issues. I get another job, change things around, and not sit there with my hand out to say, I ran out of money I need more please! Put more people to work within your companies, mentor them, teach them to do what they need to do to better themselves. Create a paid learning program. Help the government help you. Is it a one time thing? It should be. If I give a person a fish I feed him for the day. If I teach him to fish I feed him for life. Perhaps examine where the changes need to start.",-1
39,"A company serves the interests of many people other then the owners and shareholders of the company. Two most important of these groups are the employees and the consumers. The bailout of a company is justified on the basis of protecting the interest of the employees and the consumer. Just think of a situation if the company that supplies electricity to your house, what would you support - shutdown of the company and your power supply, or bailout of the power company.",-1
39,"Bailouts save a lot of jobs and when utilized correctly help save the economy from taking a major shot. While they obviously aren't a popular decision at the time they are made, when distributed to deserving companies and not everyone under the sun that needs help, the history proves they end up being for the best.",-1
39,"Yes, the government should bail out companies, under certain circumstances. Though doing so seems to go against the capitalistic concepts that make up our nation's economy philosophy, their have been periods, such as the Great Depression and the economic crash of 2008, where direct government intervention in the economy has been necessary. The care industry is an example of successful government bail-out. If major care companies had folded in 2008, the loss of jobs and general effect on the economy would have been stunning. By providing loans to prop up companies such as GM and Chrysler, many of those jobs were saved. In addition, only a few years after facing bankruptcy those companies were on the road to recovery, paying back their loans and even thriving. By judicious use of “bail-out” funds, the government can have a positive effect on our economy.",-1
39,If a big firm is allowed to fail their contracts will be taken up by small or medium sized firms so long as there's still demand for that type of work. These small or medium sized firms then need to recruit employees. Government intervention in markets seems odd to me it's like insider trading propping markets up and sometimes the government even guaranteed the firm work through government contracts which should be illegal as it is actually corruption at the tender phase favouring one more expensive company over another. Ultimately the taxpayer gets less for their money.,1
39,"If one business is bailed out all should. It doesn't save jobs it ruins jobs that people create, favoritism has destroyed so many jobs and government shouldn't be filling their pockets when they get tax money from owning people. The reason america not doing so well is because most of the money is monopolized by few rich and not enough wealth circulating for others to create jobs.",1
39,Why would we bail out a failing company when they were the ones that got themselves into the problem. Plus by doing that all were doing is saying that failure is ok. People don't understand that when we spend money on a large company that we hurt the smaller ones below it,1
39,"If companies can see a bailout as a saving grace if they ever need it, it would increase the rate of reckless and unexplainable behaviour within the business world. Bankruptcies are one of the only regulating feature of the market, and if governments continue to bail out large companies destined for bankruptcy, this would only cause major inflation, and a possible Global Financial Crises. As we have seen in history, such events may lead to war and death of innocent people. Money is an item that corrupts the minds of our best, yet we follow it religiously...",1
39,They should not spend tax dollars on that. Companies will never end up paying it back. Just like with the auto bail out. As soon as they started making money again and got the bail out money they gave the executives a bonus. They should have been paying that money back.,1
39,"it's times like this when one must bear in mind the cynical version of the golden rule: He who has the gold is the one who makes all the rules. In the private sector, that includes the people who own the newspapers, cable channels and TV stations where news is presented. A government bailout wouldn't be any different.",1
39,"If journalists become beholden to the government, for money or for anything else, they cease to be free. It becomes much harder to criticize government spending, for example, if you are a beneficiary of it. By the same token, the risk of losing these funds creates a chilling effect on any reporting that is critical of the government, as a whole, or of the politicians within it.",1
39,"The issue here is not whether a bailout would mean the government actually exerts power or influence over the press, more than it does now, but what the public perception would be. A government bailout of journalism would end free press, because of the implications of that bailout. If I give you money, chances are their are strings attached, and I want something in return. The question everyone would be asking is what? What does the government want in return? Perception is reality. In this case, the perception would be that free press was over, and so it would be.",1
39,"A government bailout of the journalism sector would not cure the woes of the sector, but would merely work to hinder press freedom. The journalism sector is undergoing a sea of change in the way news is consumed by the public at large. This sea of change is caused by technology, not by a lack of funds flowing into the sector.",1
39,"Money is a powerful motivator. Bailing out the media or journalists may make them indebted, even subconsciously, and alter their perception of the government's actions. This can skew reports in favor of the government. If money had not been involved, the journalists wouldn't feel this obligation. there is already too much outside influence on mainstream media; we are losing good investigative journalism. An influx of government money to journalists would make this even worse.",1
39,"The most important role of the free press is to remain independent from government and to provide the people with unbiased reporting on their actions. Government bailouts are inevitably tied to oversight, as government micromanages the financial operations of failing industries. A government bailout of the press would lead to government management of the reported content. While perhaps not a deliberate attempt to prevent reporting, oversight of spending would result in control of the decisions of what to report, and when. The free press must remain autonomous to perform its function.",1
39,"A government bailout would give the government the upper hand in regulating the press. The press should be free and not subject to such a higher authority. The press is going through an evolution with the changing electronic environment. Once the press adjusts to the changes, it will be able to get back on its feet, rather then depending on the government.",1
39,"Yes, a government bailout of journalism would destroy the free press because then the government would be telling the papers what to print and what to say. If people don't read the papers then they should go out of business. The government should not be involved in any private businesses.",1
39,"Citizen journalism has a tendency to be unreliable and misleading. Of course there are plenty of citizen journalists who are ethical in their reporting, source all of their information, and are on par with journalistic professionals. But their are also a lot of citizen journalists who don't bother to double-check their facts, or worse, who intentionally or recklessly promote completely unverified facts. The mechanisms in place for the mainstream media to ensure that information is accurate and news stories are reliable are invaluable. Mainstream journalism will always be necessary to ensure that the news is credible and believable. Citizen journalism is an important piece of the news landscape, but it cannot be the only piece.",1
39,"If somehow the journalism industry found itself in big enough trouble to warrant a government bailout, it could destroy the freedom of the press, or free press, to a certain extent because journalists might feel indebted to the government and therefore be less critical then they might be otherwise. Additionally, if the government bailed out the journalism industry, the government would essentially be considered it's boss, and could select what is appropriate and what is not.",1
39,"The whole notion of a free-press is that it operates under freedom. If big newspapers or media outlets were bailed out by the government, that could give incentives to the government to demand what is reported, what is questioned, and what isn't. This private-public relationship as a result of a bailout would be detrimental to a free republic that promotes a free press..",1
39,Congress has a history of wanting to have a say in how things are don't if the government provides funding. It would be VERY tempting for Congress to want to make helpful suggestions on how the institutions receiving funds should handle certain policies. I fear this would lead to government having a control of the newspapers. This would NOT be good for a free press.,1
39,"Interference with the press by the government in any way, including bailouts, is not a good idea. Our free press is guaranteed by the Constitution. Without the free press, the people would not be informed of many things that the government is doing, and we certainly need someone who is watching what our elected officials are doing and informing the public. If the free press received a government bailout, I am afraid that the government would expect to have some control of our media.",1
39,"That state of journalism has deteriorated in an age of mass consolidation and irresponsible layoffs. Today, journalists' decision-making is largely driven by page views, not the public interest. Corporate owners have succeeded in convincing journalists that profits are the ticket to saving journalism, and the constant hunt for revenue heavily influences the way journalists do their jobs. But in reality, there are plenty of alternatives to profit-driven journalism. Government support is one of them. Look at the state of corporate-controlled media. Would government subsidies really compromise the free press any more then ruthless corporate cuts already do? The purpose of government subsidies would be to embolden journalism as a pillar of our democracy, not to diminish the Fourth Estate. The key, of course, is to do it purposefully and responsibly.",-1
39,"If you start imposing limits based on content then we've compromised the free press. If we base it on financial need, that is fine. In fact if the government would give the more financially needy sectors of the media subsidies it could help increase media diversity, potentially exposing people to even more views.",-1
39,"Organizations which truly are members of what we refer to as the free press are going to continue writing with journalistic integrity regardless of who finances their business model. I think this is demonstrated by the press elements which are funded by private organizations, yet are willing to write about the failures of the places where their funding comes from. Also, I doubt the government finds the press so important that it must be bailed out.",-1
39,"We already have government supported journalism in our NPR programs and that has not killed the free press. If anything a government bailout of journalism would only guarantee that all sides are heard, not just the news agency with the most money.",-1
39,"The government can and has already controlled what the free press can say through threatening to remove their journalistic licenses. The government has tons of ways to pressure the news reporters into doing what they want, usually threatening their right to broadcast or publish their stories. A bailout will not really change anything about how modern news is reported.",-1
39,"The government would hold no upper hand if they bailed out the press. The press is still going to print what they want to print when they want to print it. Government control would bring us to a point where there would be protests of free press. Whether what the press writes is true or not, it still brings publicity and light to things that may need to be seen, positive or not. I can not see the government gaining any control.",-1
39,We have the world wide web. The WWW is the new free press. Anyone and everyone who has access to the Internet is the new free press. Free press in no longer about making money off stories about everything; it's about getting the truth out. We all have the right to be informed without having to pay to hear the truth.,-1
39,"A government bailout does not have to have an influence on the freedom of the press. Whether, or not, it does is dependent on everyone involved and the final terms, which are agreed upon. The government would be completely wrong to limit the freedoms of a certain press because they have bailed that certain press out. And, that certain press does not have to agree to such terms.",-1
39,"it's become more apparent to me that art serves an important economic purpose. Time and again, you will see artists move in to low-rent, struggling neighborhoods because that's what they can afford. Often, a sort of urban, bohemian culture develops in these places, which eventually draws in the creative class and, as a result, money. Rent and real estate costs rise and, ironically, artists effectively force themselves out of these places because they just can't afford what they've taken part in creating. So on to the next project. So it seems there would be an economic justification for a city investing in arts education. I think committed artists accept that they probably won't get rich. But if education is more available, it's something of a win-win. Public arts projects also may provide a sort of incentive for this, and they can contribute to making places where the creative class wants to live.",-1
39,"If the government were to end the arts funding, then it would be like destroying our culture. Music, art, and literature, as well as food and clothing, make up our culture. By getting rid of all these things we are throwing about half of America's culture in the trash and leaving future generations with a loss of identity.",-1
39,"In his December 2008 article ""No Bailout for the Arts?"" Michael Kaiser, President of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts said that ""Unlike other industries, the arts cannot cover the cost of inflation by improving worker productivity. This is why subsidies-- in the from of government grants or private contributions-- have long been required to help arts organizations balance their budgets."" I also appreciate that he acknowledges that the arts are a very necessary part of our economy and our education system. ""As we reshape our economy, we are losing the organizations that teach our children to think creatively.""",-1
39,"The arts enliven us, make us more profound thinkers, and indicate our humanity. They tell the great stories of history - and the great stories of the everyday. Because they are edifying, and because that edification comes in a variety of artistic forms (such as music, theatre, poetry, dance, painting or photography), our gross and fine motor skills develop when we engage in the arts. The arts are also from of communication, as necessary to communication as oral and written language, for the arts are languages. We communicate with other members of our species, homosapiens, through the arts. The arts keeps us from becoming drones.",-1
39,"The government should definitely support the arts, by providing funding for public museums and concert venues. Art is something that will last forever, and will act as a window to our time for future generations. there are too many ""starving artists"" who can't afford to pursue their art because there's no money in it.",-1
39,"Government should continue to subsidize the arts. Without government funding, the arts in this country could easily languish. Especially in difficult economic times like we are having now, the arts provides jobs for many people but without government subsidies, these fields would have to rely on philanthropy which has dropped precipitously since the economic recession began.",-1

But I do believe it is necessary for a ""well-rounded"" community. I enjoy good pictures, good music, and good books, but none of what I enjoy can really be considered ""culture."" I have never been to the opera, the ballet, or to an art museum, so I don't have sufficient knowledge of these areas. But I do know that music can be very soothing, and books can provide wonderful relaxation. They take you away from your everyday life, and expose you to other cultures.",-1

Disallowing the arts can be used as a wedge to defund just about any project for political or adversarial issues. We have to allow the pure arts without any deliberate functionality to them to ensure that all useful arts are protected. Cultural workers are one population even though their activities may seem different at first glance.",-1

This was don't with bridges and picnic shelters, libraries and other structures during the 19830s, many of which are still useful and attractive. Government subsidies of massive writing projects such as the one don't in the 1930s resulted in a tremendous outpouring of great work that we are still enjoying, along with the collection of stories and data that might have vanished otherwise. And there should always be support for civic music programs and children's programs.",-1

39,"The visual, literary, and musical arts are essential aspects of culture. The arts are both expressive, providing creative outlets for human ingenuity, and impressive, providing ways of shaping individuals and society.

See Aristotle, especially, for a treatise on the ways the arts, especially poetics and music, from the best of human character.",-1

I believe that empathy and logic align, and that both are essential in seeking and defining truth. Art should go hand in hand with science and math in what is important.",-1
39,"The government should definitely subsidize the arts in small ways. Theater, music and literature have always benefited humans intellectually. A culture rich in the arts is one that is capable of growth and enlightenment. The arts provide escapism from the rigor of daily life and also provide joy and excitement. The best way for the government to support artistic expression is to encourage it by supporting schools of the performing arts and allowing art festivals to occur, providing both profit and entertainment for locals.",-1
39,"We all benefit from a healthy artistic environment in our country, and government subsidy encourages creation of art for the people as a whole. Art can help us think and understand ourselves as individuals, as a nation, and as human beings. It is important not to treat art simply as a product, because that will require artists to cater their work to those who can afford to pay high enough prices so they can support themselves. Government subsidy of the arts allows a greater diversity of work to flourish, for the benefit of all who live in our country.",-1
39,"The subsidization of arts is something that goes back in history as far back as can be remembered. In a capitalist society it is silly to think that the arts will be supported by the consumer. If we are interested in the continual growth of the arts, grants are important. The same can be said of scientific research.",-1
39,"I think that the government should subsidize the arts because art is a necessary component of communities. Through art, communities are able to express themselves, individuals are able to express their ideas, and communities are able to find and create new direction and envision the path that they want to take to develop. On the same mindset, culture is also maintained and developed by arts such as visual arts, dance, music, etc. As a result, art is critical for a person to express themselves and for a community to feel whole.",-1
39,The arts are an important part of society. They show a civilization's history and culture. They help future society's learn about their past. They need to be preserved. Museums and art are important to the world. Arts should also be taught in schools. It is important for young people to be taught about art as well.,-1

Talent comes from every person and should most definitely not just come from the ""wealthy"".",-1

Having said that, when you travel the world you will see many awful modern sculptures on roundabouts which utterly defeat the pro subsidy argument.",-1
39,"Most civilized countries support the arts through government subsidies so that their can be a rich and diverse reflection of a nation in the culture. In challenging economic times such as these, the need for financial support to art programs becomes all the more necessary; as citizens struggle to cover their own bills, artistic donations and tickets become a luxury. By providing government support, the nation benefits from free art programs to the citizens and from maintaining a cultural identify by keeping artists at work.",-1
39,"it's become more apparent to me that art serves an important economic purpose. Time and again, you will see artists move in to low-rent, struggling neighborhoods because that's what they can afford. Often, a sort of urban, bohemian culture develops in these areas, which eventually draws in the creative class and, as a result, money. I live in Chicago, where this has already happened in the Wicker Park neighborhood and is now concentrated in Logan Square and Pilsen. In effect, these artists do a lot of the work of ""cleaning up"" troubled neighborhoods. Rent and real estate costs rise and, ironically, the artists effectively force themselves out of these places because they can't afford what they've taken part in creating. So on to the next project. I think artists accept that their craft is unlikely to make them wealthy, but it seems as though the city's investing in arts education, especially at the level of higher education, creates a win-win, where aspiring artists have a chance to get affordable training and the city ends up attracting more business.",-1
39,"The arts overall define who we are, their is where children begin to explore and take hold of their identity. It is also a way to express yourself and shapes them of who they want to be in the future. The arts can replace the many flaws from this society, from an early age where children start to appreciate and respect what surrounds them.",-1
39,"In my perspective, artists deserve to receive full support from government. Good art make our world a better place to live. Who does not want to live in a world that has good music, good painting, good literature, and good clothing? Art reaches to every field of our daily life, they have been an essential opponent of human world since day one. A rich artistic environment help humans to learn and identify themselves in variety of ways. However, making a life out of art is not considered as a secure employment by society nowadays. As a result, their are not many people who are dedicated to art. In order to better support the development of art, government should further subsidize art. By doing this, government gets to provide more opportunity and freedom to those who are willing to create an artistic environment for the society.

People who live in the beautiful world are more friendly and open-minded. If in a country live a lot of artists, they create a pieces of art which decorate cities which affect in positive way on human. Another important reason, why government should funding to the Art, nowadays under influences of artists many people have different hobby which often linked to the Art. The various kind of craft successfully fill leisure time of people. Nowadays many people prefer spend time doing some art activities instead sitting on the pub. Also, art attract a lot of people to the country. We can see how many people travel to the France for visiting Louvre",-1

39,"When a government decides to spend money protecting a certain place, idea, or resource, the object of interest benefits greatly from the attention; far more then if it were protected by a mere non-profit organization. Recently, a construction company in Berlin, Germany bought a tract of land on which the last remaining remnant of the Berlin Wall is standing. In order to build an access road to luxury flats, construction workers decided to tear down most of the mile-long remnant of the Berlin Wall, despite public demonstrations and protestations. This monument to history has stood as a reminder to the world of the horror of communism for decades, and now it is gone. Because the government refused to spend any money protecting this landmark, future generations will now never be able to walk the length of this wall and experience first-hand some of the desolation of separation that Germans lived through. In Egypt, a group of Muslim Jihadists are petitioning the government to allow them to tear down the Pyramids of Giza because they were built as idols to false gods. “The Muslims are obliged to apply the Sharia (Islamic law), including the removal of the idols,” leading Jihadist Al Gohari stated (Jihadist 3). These extremist Jihadists are “resolved to destroy all idols in Egypt” (Jihadist 7). The current Egyptian president is currently refusing to allow this destruction, as the pyramids are a significant example of ancient culture. However, if a more pro-Jihad politician takes over in Egypt, the situation might change, in which case UNESCO and other governments must use their resources to protect this landmark. Currently, the majority of these historical sites are still in existence, but there are several factors that could change that fact very quickly. The current economic crisis of the world is resulting in government authorities wishing to cease funding of the restoration and protection of historical sites. UNESCO alone has an annual budget of $653 million, and that is still nowhere near enough to accomplish everything that they hope to do. The United States government is currently funding over 1600 different programs for a total of $2 trillion. Recently, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology released a report detailing the $4.3 billion a year of government money that goes toward funding STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) programs (Geller 2). They justified this use of the money by talking about how the education of young people in areas of science and technology was vital to today’s culture. If education in science and technology is worth $4.3 billion, then surely the government can justify funding programs to encourage the education in the areas of history and culture.",-1

I feel that the government should subsidize art to an extent because art is a part of our culture.",-1
39,"Without government support, the arts would not be able to reach as many people, especially those in areas without access to art or with low-arts participation because of a lack of facilities, etc. Prices for some places would be higher and, let's face it, Europe and Australia have more government involvement in art and the world's not ending. there's two realms, non-profit (which get government funding) and for-profit. The for-profit galleries, like those in Chelsea with ""garbage art"" (no one wants to miss out on the next big artist, hence a lot of it being sub-par to some), don't get government subsidies. They can't apply and they can't get donations because of their tax-code. Nonprofits need the help in order to cover ahead costs, or lower their prices in order to attract more people. They're mission based, or supposed to be, and often have to charge higher prices without government aid because they have bills and paychecks to pay. With aid, they're able to lower their prices and make their art more accessible. Which is the point of government aid. Conspiracies aside, it's meant to help citizens become better and well-rounded, and income level should not determine your access and exposure to art of all kinds. If the arts don't get funding, all of those museums, theaters, and concert halls that are non-profit, get to increase their prices if they need to. Arts become more inaccessible. Areas with potential growth in the arts suffer because of the lack of spillover from people having dinner before seeing a show. there's a lot more at play then people often realize. Also, Gentrification is not always a good thing (it drives up rent for one thing, artists move to low-rent areas and then the galleries follow, not immediately, but in time). It pushes out the people who were originally their, like families and small businesses, etc.",-1
39,"As far as the economy goes, art is becoming less valued over time (a frightening example is the current state of the music industry)--people want more art for less investment--but we need art to sustain a society worth living in. If government subsidy were more prevalent, more artists could focus on art without being distracted by other worries. Many of my artist friends have very low output because art does not pay well enough to sustain living.",-1

39,"Everything comes at a cost. If we don't support healthy and vibrant art communities, artists with diverse backgrounds and opinions and new ways of viewing our world, we will end up with a stale, yet flashy art that offers thrills with no real substance. The way to keep the arts from becoming two tiered with ""high art"" for the wealthy and ""low art"" for the rest is to have more subsidized art not less. The theatre is a perfect example. Professional theatre ticket prices have skyrocketed, even for ""straight"" (non-musical) theatre. Our best new playwrights would not have their works produced if they hadn't been given a start in the not-for-profit theatres first.",-1

39,"it's important for society to nurture the importance of art through public funding, because without it art becomes a luxury item for those who can afford it. Some might argue that it currently is a luxury item, but those people are ignoring the links between students who regularly are exposed to artistic projects and programs and academic achievement in the areas of science and mathematics advancement. Art promotes the best uses of our metal resources, those of us who regularly participate in artistic endeavors tend to be better problem solvers. Art encourages the embrace of who we are, who we strive to be, and it encourages the same type of outside the box thinking that leads to unexplored frontiers and new areas of scientific creation and advancement. In closing consider these facts about kids who are exposed to, and encouraged in, artistic endeavors: 4 times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement 3 times more likely to be elected to class office within their schools 4 times more likely to participate in a math and science fair 3 times more likely to win an award for school attendance 4 times more likely to win an award for writing an essay or poem These same students are more likely to score higher on advanced standardized testing like the ACT and the SAT.

At the same time as we subsidize the rich by these donations to the arts, we tax other more productive industries which provide jobs to the working classes. The poorer elements of society are thus further damaged by this policy. Art has been around for thousands of years before government subsidies were introduced and their is no reason to believe culture will die without it. The ""culture"" found in art galleries and theaters does not generally represent the culture that most people inhabit if they are not wealthy. The culture most people recognize is found in commercial settings in films and book which thrive perfectly well without subsidy.",1

But as adults, we have to resist the temptation to think that what we are individually doing is somehow the greatest thing since the proverbial first loaf of sliced bread and that therefore it must receive more than what people give it willingly (that is, that it should also get some of their money unwillingly through taxes). -Lawrence Reed",1
39,"I like art. In fact, I'm a musician. It has, however, never crossed my mind that I should take other people's money to pay for it. Here's the deal: people pay more for what they want. If people don't pay enough for your art, then they don't want it enough. If you insist on producing it regardless, it should be at your personal expense; it's not up to you to tell people what to want, just how it's not up to anyone else to tell you how much you want their services, despite their strong conviction that their product or service ""enliven"" us or ""indicate our humanity"". To claim otherwise is unbelievably pretentious; just because you're passionate about art, doesn't mean you can impose your values on other people. To address the ""economic"" argument that has been made by Michael Kaiser: most services are in the same position. I don't think barbers have been made more productive in a while, yet I don't see why we should offer them subsidies. Besides, anyone who has learned enough about inflation to think they can argue about it knows it doesn't change purchasing power (unless you have money sitting around and losing value, which isn't an artist's case apparently). If artists anticipate inflation, they should raise their prices, since that's what everyone else is doing; ultimately their revenue will be able to buy the same goods and services; if no one buys their art at that price, then people don't want it anymore. This argument is, at best, a fallacy, and at worse, an effort to obfuscate people into agreement.",1

If artists would be supported by the government but people who are sleeping under bridges and are fighting for their lives aren't, Where is the justice?

The NHS should be funded due to the fact during 2011/2012 the NHS had a deficit of £121.4bn pounds over their set budget of 104bn pounds which is equivalent to £3000 pounds per second. Furthermore the public schools have also experienced spending cuts. During 2011/2012 the government had pledged to protect the education budget from cuts and also had said that they would help poorer children but the annual reports have shown that the Department for Educations spending has gone from £58.28bn to £56.27bn. This cut had been agreed before inflation was taken into account. Rather than helping to encourage creativity and diversity, state funding of the arts can cause them to stagnate. Art can and does thrive without the support of government. Government arts funding began in Britain in 1946. Previous generations of playwrights and artist (Shakespeare include) were supported only by patrons and fee paying audiences. These days’ artists have many more means of finding audiences to support their work. Crowd funding services such as Kick starter are matching artists with those who are willing to pay. Kick starter is one of the World’s largest funding platforms for creative projects. If people from the arts were to go to funding companies the governments would not have to fund the arts. This would save a lot of money for the government to uses to a greater cause. Say if the government funded into 1000 places and people of the arts. Not all of these places or people will be successful and in the process the government is losing money in this process. By Rahedgefunder",1

They need to provide for their families just like you and I do, just because they have a farm doesn't mean they don't mean they have enough money or food for them to live especially when that food is for selling and it's a bad crop season. So all you naysayers obviously don't know what a financial struggle is.",-1
39,"For one, subsidized farming stabilizes the agricultural commodity markets overall. Granting agricultural workers these funds ensures that their will not be price spikes in general necessities (food, clothing, etc.) because the subsidies can compensate for poor yields for reasons including poor weather (an uncontrollable force). Not only that, but this money would also make for a predictable farming system. Farmers would have the ability to stay up-to-date with farming systems and equipment, and, consequently, increase productivity. Secondly, agriculture holds a large portion of economy; therefore, ending these subsidies would only hinder the economy. Looking at the United States, agriculture accounts for $789 billion of our GDP (but this isn't the entirety of agriculture's effect on the GDP because this number does not take relying industries - like forestry, fishing, food, apparel, leather, etc. - into account. Agriculture also accounts for 16.9 million jobs in the United States (9.2% of United States employment). This being said, removing the subsidies would deter and push workers away from agriculture. Lastly, agriculture in and of itself is a growing science that could benefit people and the environment. Alternative fuel sources like ethanol and bio methane are both produced through agriculture. Ethanol, although it is not a fully developed method, makes use of the gasses omitted from plant material (corn, sugarcane, grasses) and there has been a recent increase in usage (1.7 billion gallons in 2001 to 13.2 billion gallons in 2013). Biomethane makes use of the gasses from animal byproducts and agricultural waste. Both of these alternative fuel sources would reduce our dependence on oil (so from a United States perspective, our dependence on foreign countries; and from an international perspective, increase energy security by offsetting non-renewable resources), decrease the amounts of greenhouse gasses being emitted, make for a cleaner environment (by reducing landfill waste and producing nutrient-rich fertilizer). Overall, ending agricultural subsidies only hinders people overall. Maintaining them, on the other hand, has the potential to maintain a stable market for necessities, maintain (or perhaps benefit) the nation's economy, and provide alternative fuels (increasing energy security and decreasing some greenhouse gas emissions).",-1
39,I believe that the government should not stop subsidizing farmers. Subsidizing is needed to sustain farmers to the point where they can break even. Food prices are contained by subsidizing. Family budgets will be kept reasonable as well. To sustain the quality of life of the family farm it is very important for government subsidies.,-1
39,"Farming and agriculture is very important for the sustainability of our country. Growing food ourselves helps the economy by providing jobs and work while keeping our funds internal instead of sending them overseas to purchase food stuffs externally.

39,"Why? Well, they are by far cheaper than fossil fuels, and could spark the end of poverty. The needy wouldn't need to buy fossil fuels to heat their homes, for example, if biofuels were widely available. Also, they are renewable fuels, and therefore slow down the deterioration of our World. In essence, by using biofuels, we can not only end poverty, but do what's best for our home. Using biofuels could ensure that two of our major crises cease to exist. Surely it's not too much to ask?",-1
39,"We are way too dependent as a nation on foreign oil, at a high cost to the consumer. By subsidizing biofuels, we can get off that dependence, and lower the costs of fuel to us at the same time. there has to be other, cheaper fuel sources out their, their just has to be. Oil should not be the only one we rely on. So yes I do think government should subsidize biofuels.",-1
39,"I believe that governments should subsidize biofuels in order to promote finding alternative forms of energy that can help reduce the world's dependence on oil and gasoline. Subsidizing biofuels would promote more scientists and companies to invest in alternative energy, which will help reduce climate change and provide energy for the future.",-1
39,"Biofuels, as stated in previous arguments, are less efficient as currently existing petroleum products. The United States already has enough oil to support itself, but the government does not want to take advantage of the oil reserves that we already have. Biofuels also require massive amounts of land to be cultivated and are said to drive up the prices of food, something we don't need as we begin to come out of this recession. By switching over corn from a product used for feeding people to fuel production, we are doing a disservice to those who need to eat.",1
39,"Biofuels are ineffective and will not be profitably until they become more efficient. Furthermore, government subsidies always distort the free market, and if the product was any good, it wouldn't require subsidization. By subsidizing a less than perfect product we negatively affect the private businesses that actually produce top notch products in that field.",1
39,"The federal government subsidizes certain industries to try to give them a competitive edge. Big oil, farmers, green energy and medical fields all get taxpayer funding for various ventures.

Subsidies amount to socialism, not capitalism.",1

The subsidies are out of control, and any minimal amount of subsidies you put in will be mismanaged. If you own a house that zoned as farming land, you can get mooch the government for more money. You also pick winners and losers, as some foods are not eligible for subsidies and some are. Yes there are huge mega farms that really consume a vast amount of resources. And if farmers are struggling their is such a thing as crop insurance.",1

Farming is a big business in our nation and everything needs to be don't to help farmers sustain their business, which will strengthen our economy a lot.",-1
39,"I think farm subsidies need to be increased, but the focus needs to be elsewhere. Most farm subsidies are given to farmers who agree to abandon their crops and start growing a lot of corn. The opposite should happen. We should have farm subsidies for fruit and vegetable and organic animal farmers.",-1

Ethanol is another product that has not proven to be cost effective, a good resource as a fuel additive, or generally effective on any level. Yet there's still a subsidy for it. Instead of paying people to grow things we don't need, just to line monsanto's pockets, why don't we use that money to create markets for the products that farmers grow instead.",-1

If you give it this responsibility, then you give it too much power over you and therefore open it up to corruption.

Entrepreneurs and charities would most likely manage the money better then the government which has an ever-increasing national debt. Because of this, they would also be the ones who actually have the money to help these people. It would be people helping other people in the community, not a faraway government program that has so many loopholes it's useless.",1

Government by definition is inefficient and wasteful compared to free enterprise (including non-profits that rely on achievements for donations) that must continuously succeed and improve to stay alive. Similar studies can be found for other government programs. ""Head Start"" has consistently been found, in evaluations based on randomized, controlled trials, to provide little or no lasting benefit to students. Yet it's heavily funded by taxpayers' dollars.",1
54,"Yes, charities are more effective than government. Charities don't have all of the government’s bureaucracy and layers of red tape to get through before they can jump into a situation and start helping people. This reflects sadly on our government’s ability to help disaster victims in a timely manner. Our government should take a lesson here and realize that reactions to disasters need to be immediate – not promised for future delivery.",1
54,"This is a hard question, but I am thinking more on a level of very local charities in which the community itself deals with it's own impoverished. Government is too large and impersonal and makes decisions from a distance. Government programs are generally subject to much abuse in terms of fraud perpetrated by applicants. In a local community people know which people are truly in need. I tend to focus on local charities because large charity organizations seem to eat up most of their donations keeping themselves afloat, and very little trickles down to the people they are supposed to be helping. In the good old days people in need would go to their local churches, collections would be taken up, and donations for them. I suppose government had to take over this role because the world has just gotten too overpopulated, but government is not the best agency to handle it.",1
54,"Charities can be much more efficient than government. They are able to operate with lower cost and give more direct help to those who need it. Charities fail to be effective because they have limited resources. It would be nearly impossible for charities to run the Medicaid system, giving money to impoverished people who need medical help. They might be able to run the Medicaid system with less overhead cost, but they wouldn't be able to reach as many people due to limited capital.",-1

It is true that government can sometimes outsource or partner with a charity, but at the end of the day, government is the most efficient way to reach the greatest number of people and to ensure that services are delivered without discrimination. Part of the problem is that charities have to spend most of their time fundraising, which makes them less productive.",-1

Consequently, Individuals within the government might have a moral obligation to help others, Said so you don't have to donate to charity to help, You should instead go volunteer, Because If everyone donates and nobody volunteers, their will not be a change. Governments might try to achieve the preservation of human rights and not favor the rich and the creation of monopolies, But the solution is not to obtain free stuff, The solution is for us to push them to prevent the things previously mentioned.

If everyone donates but nobody volunteers, Nothing will happen. The few people who ARE employed by the charity will be richer and no changes will be made. Go help your neighbor fix their care, Or something. JUST HELP OTHERS ON YOUR OWN! Government is (or should be) about the preservation of rights, Not wealth. I do understand that the existing government favors the rich and powerful and we suffer for it, But the solution is not for US to get free stuff, The solution is for us to push them to prevent monopolies, Fear mongering, And corporate control. Also, Don't forget that their will still be individuals telling empathy-begging sob-stories to pander for your support in making the government give them free stuff for their hardships. People who REALLY need help will seek it out from other individuals, And not demand it from big daddy government. CLOSING STATEMENT: Legally forced morality/ethicality creates a lack of legitimate concern and love for one another. Over the years, We lose any reason for actually helping people beyond the legal, And thus become selfish.

That word implies that it is something that must be don't and don't well. their is a difference between the words must and should. Charities can help and how much they help is a measure of how healthy the society itself is. If the charities are not taking care of all of the poor, this is a sign that the society does not have sufficient free cash to do so or that it's people have decided something is wrong with the definition of poor or the reason the people are poor. If government gets involved the bureaucracy and written rules take over and the checks and balances of the system are subverted to the point that changing conditions go unnoticed and are not dealt with. This leads to riots and revolution as the means of bringing problems to the notice of the authorities.",1

With A nationally funded healthcare system that does not require insurance, you can maximize the quality of healthcare, and ensure that everyone's well being and good health is an absolute right. With safety nets, you can ensure that people have a minimum standard of living to afford basic necessities and housing. With a Completely nationally funded public school and college system, you can maximize the quality of education, and ensure that access to educational resources for citizens is an absolute right. Taxes should ultimately be a way for people to pay into the system, so that the system can maintain itself, and give the people the most benefit possible, and ensure everyone's civil liberties (with maximized civil liberties).

With modern accusations of lobbied crony capitalism, historians and economists comment that we have reverted back to those days when nepotism and privilege gets you on top, not hard work and integrity: core American values Here is my question to those who don't agree that the government should do something. 1950s American prosperity was not the products of hard work and integrity alone. It required the crucial element of a democratic government that listened to its people and implemented regulations to protect them. Republicans back then (like H Hoover whom did nothing to alleviate the Depression) clung to misguided notions of trickle down economics and accused FDR of socialist policies. The question is: aside from post Red Scare propaganda, who in the right wing camp actually can explain socialist ideology in a civilized manner? Perhaps we should shed the pro-corporate propaganda fed to us over the ,sat 2 decades about lazy civil servant ""takers"" and the old ""hard work vs las"" mantra.

Across the world, big corporations and bankers receive subsidies, low-interest rate loans, and many other financial gifts from central banks that use inflation, via the massive printing of money, to enrich themselves and their allies. When the money is printed, it's purchasing power remains the same as if the supply of it had not increased. Therefore, the first receivers benefit by spending free money with no bad consequences. This is how the federal government goes to war so often. But by the time this money has reached the bottom of the market and been exchanged continuously between middle class and poor consumers, the market has assimilated the new supply rate and rose prices, creating inflation.

18,"While the poor are getting poorer, the rich are getting richer. their needs to be something don't to make the score a little more even. The taxes aren't helping, and they aren't enough. Those who should be making more money, such as the military and teachers, are the most underpaid. The government needs to find a way.",-1
18,"Increasing the minimum wage would go a long way towards leveling out some of the sizable increases that have been seen in recent years, such as rising gas and food prices. If the rich simply sit on their money, America's economy, as a whole, will continue to stagnate, to the detriment of the nation. Increasing the taxes on the wealthy is another way to achieve this goal. Regardless, a sizable effort has to be made to understand why this is happening.",-1
18,"What bothers me about extreme income inequality, and this may be only a partial description, is the sense it gives that some people are in a protected, exclusive class while others have much less access to opportunity. The former may not always achieve their status at the direct expense of the latter, and direct redistribution may do more harm than good. But income mobility has declined in the United States in recent decades, and Horatio Alger's famed rags-to-riches story would now be more likely in a number of European countries. The question of upward mobility is somewhat separate, but when considered together with high income inequality, it produces the divisive sense that America is free on some abstract level, and likes it's freedom rhetoric plenty, but in real life takes care of some people while consigning many more to insecurity. Government can't solve this alone, but it shouldn't be passive either.",-1
18,"This used to be a country where all people could aspire to have a better life than their parents. This is no longer the case. The majority of the children today face very few jobs, low wages, high debts for education, and will most likely not do as well as their parents. there are more and more previously middle-class people joining the ranks of the poor. This is occurring while a small population of people has been gaining more and more income, without having to produce anything of real value. their is something wrong with a society which allows the majority of its wealth to be in the hands of a few people. It is more like a monarchy then a democracy.",-1
18,"Current tax law favors the wealthy. The tax code is so complex that lower-income people end up paying the full amount they are responsible for. The wealthy, who can afford the advice of accountants and lawyers, end up paying less then the amount assigned to them. their will always be some who are rich and some who are poor. History has shown this. However, this does not mean that the government should not take action to address the problem.",-1
18,The wealth of the United States has become extremely concentrated as the middle class has become the working poor. The outsourcing of manufacturing jobs has brought economic hardship to hundreds of towns and cities in the United States. As a result the United States is experiencing a loss in technical and skilled positions as well. The United States government needs to take action to reverse these substantial losses because corporations and individuals in the market will not adjust the current trends and policies.,-1
18,"This country is losing its middle class, while the wealthy just keep getting more and more. When jobs are lost, it isn't usually the jobs at the top, it's the jobs at the bottom and the middle, where our middle class is. it's hard to see the justification in the amount of money some people make. They sit back and watch it roll in while middle class Americans have to work their butts off until they can afford to retire, and by then they are too old to enjoy it.",-1
18,"The United States has been built on the premise that if you work hard, you will succeed. Many of the socialist views that are coming into play now are trying to say we need to change our system, to take from the rich and give to the poor. This is a way of rewarding bad behavior, and why should those that work hard have to pay for it? The income gap is happening for a reason, and that is because their is starting to be too much laziness around.",1
18,"The very thought of capping income or redistributing wealth is horrible. In America, we all have an equal chance. This is not a caste system. Those with high incomes are earning it. Even if at the particular moment they aren't doing much in the way of actual work, they had to work to get to the positions they are in. Anyone can do it, if they tried hard enough.",1
18,"One of the fundamental ideals that America is based upon is the opportunity to build your life and gain a fortune through hard work. It has long been part of the identity of Americans, that a person can improve their life by working hard, and governmental handouts are antithetical to this ideal.",1
18,"It is not the function of government to determine how much wealth an individual may accumulate, because setting any limit will stifle production and creativity. In a free economy, the most productive and most creative individuals will reap the greatest benefits as a reward for their productivity and creativeness.",1
18,"No, the United States government should not take steps to address the widening income gap between the wealthy and those on the lower rings with less money because if you take more of the wealthy people's money then much more people will be poor because the rich create jobs and spend money. It is not the government's job to try to make things equal for everyone. This would create total havoc in our economy. Free market capitalism, which is the American way, is the way to make more people wealthy. We should not punish success.",1
18,"No the government should never put a cap on the income of others. Why take away from people who work to put in the hands of those unwilling to work. Jesus wouldn't do it and neither will I. What that would be doing is punishing those that have a income and reinforcing those that don't. I don't means those that can't work I'm only speaking of those that are able but refuse to. I say let them earn big, someday I may be looking for a new job.",1
